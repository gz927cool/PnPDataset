Introduction to Second Edition
The most serious objection made to this book concerns its treatment (or rather lack of treatment) of eighteenth-century Rome. My original preface shows that I was aware of this potential weakness from the first, and in a generous review Hugh Honour pointed out that I preserved ‘a charmingly old-fashioned distaste for Neo-classicism’.1
Since then I have overcome this distaste and I would now certainly modify the tone of my few comments on the art of the second half of the eighteenth century. More to the point, however, is the issue of whether my ‘anti-Roman’ prejudices falsified my historical sense. Ellis Waterhouse has suggested that they did.
In an article, whose central theme was to refute Rudolf Wittkower’s claim that
‘the history of Italian eighteenth-century painting is, above all, the history of Venetian painting’. Waterhouse commented that my ‘splendid book has a fundamental defect in the author’s desire to bring the great period of Roman patronage to an end about
1700, in order to support the view that this was taken over by other parts of Italy, in particular Venice’. Waterhouse emphasised that ‘a number of the ablest painters in
Italy, Conca, Giaquinto and Batoni for instance, moved to Rome from Naples or
Tuscany; and the argument used by Francis Haskell to support the thesis of a decline of Rome in the eighteenth century from the fact that such minor personalities as P. G.
Piola, Viani, or Lazzarini, refused to settle in Rome, though strongly pressed, is more likely to be explained by the fact that they feared competition. In the seventeenth century, Guido and Guercino, for instance, had refused to stay in Rome, at a time when this argument would have been absurd.’2
This criticism must certainly carry much weight, and I have thought about it carefully. In the end, however, I find it unpersuasive. The list of distinguished Italian artists who (unlike Guido and Guercino much earlier) either failed to paint anything of consequence for the principal churches and palaces of Rome or did not even visit the city as other than tourists is a formidable one—it includes Crespi and Solimena, to name only two who are surely superior to Conca who arrived in 1707 and did not receive his first public commission for seven years. Giaquinto and Batoni came only a generation later by which time the situation had begun to change—but by which time also Tiepolo was embarking on some of his most splendid works in the Veneto.
‘Innocent XI (1676-1689) went to great efforts to keep money from the arts and he succeeded as no post-renaissance pope ever had’, it has recently been claimed,3 and though the situation improved after his death it remained bleak. Clement XI (17001721) ‘kept himself free from all nepotism’, which may be a relief for a modern historian of the papacy4 but cannot have been very encouraging for painters looking for employment, and it is surely clear beyond doubt that the attractions of Rome as a centre of

art patronage declined very seriously at this time. Indeed, in 1708, Charles-François
Poerson, director of the French Academy in the city, wrote gloomily: ‘Je crois, Mgr, que ce qui a beaucoup contribué à ce pittoyable relâchement [of painting in Rome] est le peu de fortune qu’il y a à faire en ce païs-cy. D’ailleurs les affreuses guerres, dont toute l’Europe est affligée, empêchent les Etrangers de venir icy, et c’étoient ces étrangers qui récompensoient les vertueux, car, pour MM les Italiens, ils ne sont magnifiques qu’en embrassades . . J1
In the last analysis, however, it is a qualitative judgment that has to be made. In the second decade of the eighteenth century Pope Clement XI had the church of his patron S. Clemente freshly decorated.2 As he bore a particular affection for the church we can assume that he went out of his way to employ the best artists available. The list of those chosen is therefore indicative: Sebastiano Conca, Pietro di Pietri, Giovanni
Odazzi, Pier Leoni Ghezzi, Tommaso Chiari,. Giovanni Domenico Piastrini and
Giacomo Triga. I find it as impossible to believe to-day as I did in 1963 that such a commission can compare in quality with similar ones made in the previous century or with others being given elsewhere in Italy—and notably Venice.
Waterhouse himself and the late Anthony Clark have indeed shown us how many fine painters did work in Rome during the eighteenth century, but neither in the general opinion of the time (nor, yet, in that of our own day) was it accepted that their achievements dominated European art in a way that was even remotely comparable to what was happening in the age of Pietro da Cortona with which I was mostly concerned. I therefore believe that an opinion which would indeed have been absurd in a book dealing with architecture or sculpture is quite justified in one devoted to painting.
