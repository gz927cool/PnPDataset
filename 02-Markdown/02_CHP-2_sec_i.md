AFFEO BARBERINI was born in Florence in 1568 of an old, distinguished
Mand rich family of merchants.1 He went to a Jesuit school where he showed great enthusiasm for classical literature, and at the age of 16 he was called to Rome by his uncle Monsignor Francesco, who held a number of posts at the papal court. There and at Pisa he continued his education and took a degree in law, although he was mainly interested in poetry, partly stimulated, no doubt, by the reputation of his famous fourteenth-century ancestor Francesco. A plan to marry came to nothing, and instead he began slowly to climb the ladder of papal preferment, making full use of his uncle’s prestige and purse. From the first he showed a tenacious and skilful determination to rise, which impressed all who met him. St Philip Neri prophesied that he would one day be a cardinal. His own ambitions may well have been greater.
If so, the Rome of Sixtus V in which he was now living must inevitably have made a deep and lasting effect on him. That ruthless Pope was making the most determined efforts to give back to Rome its position as centre of the world. Lawlessness, encouraged by the ancient feudal families which still dominated the Campagna if no longer the city itself, was pitilessly trampled on, and the Pope was changing the government of the Church from an oligarchy to an absolute dictatorship. At the same time he was submitting the city of Rome to the most drastic treatment it had ever received and was laying the outlines of its future development for over two centuries. Streets were hacked through the clusters of mediaeval houses that still huddled round the nobles’ palaces, opening up vast perspectives and joining the main churches across the hills and valleys. Egyptian obelisks, crowned with the emblems of triumphant Christianity, punctuated the squares and told their own story. Grandiose fountains brought fresh water to wholly new residential areas. The palaces and streets and fountains were austere, harsh and strictly functional, but towering over the city one glorious achievement was finally brought to fruition. In 1590 Michelangelo’s dome of St Peter’s was completed. Shortly afterwards the Pope died. He had reigned only five years, but during that time he had created a new city—Sistine Rome.
As the ambitious young prelate walked past the scaffolding and the gangs of workmen employed by Sixtus’s energetic architect Domenico Fontana, he was thus able to see for himself what could be achieved by power, money and ruthlessness.
Only one thing was missing—Taste. And of that Maffeo Barberini had plenty.

While his political career made satisfactory progress (by 1592, at the age of 24, he was governor of Fano), he continued to write poetry and began to show a discerning and adventurous liking for the arts. In about 1595 he had his portrait painted by a young painter who was just beginning to attract attention through the patronage of Cardinal
Francesco del Monte—Michelangelo da Caravaggio1 (Plate 2a). The painting which is thought to be this portrait shows us a seated Maffeo Barberini as he turns eagerly towards us, a lively but quizzical expression on his face, his right arm outstretched, while in his left hand he clutches a letter. Maffeo admired this powerful picture enough to return to the same artist (now very much better known) a few years later and commission from him a subject more suited to his talents—The Sacrifice os Abraham,
‘who holds the knife near the throat of his son who screams and falls’.2
In 1598 Barberini accompanied Pope Clement VIII on his visit to Ferrara to take over the city, and learnt another lesson which was to stand him in good stead some thirty years later when Urbino too fell into the hands of the papacy. The town was won by a combination of firm diplomacy and unscrupulous pressure, and once there the
Pope and his entourage took full advantage of their new prize. In particular the art treasures accumulated by the Este over the centuries were looted, and among the pictures which Cardinal Aldobrandini, the papal nephew, brought with him back to
Rome were Titian’s Worship os Venus, The Andrians and Bacchus and Ariadne.3 Curiously enough these pictures attracted little attention in Rome until Maffeo Barberini himself became Pope nearly a quarter of a century later. They then helped to lay the foundations for a wholly new artistic style.4
In 1600 his uncle died and left him a fortune variously estimated at 100,000 and
400,000 scudi. He was now in a position to have a rich family chapel built for himself, and within four years he was boasting that he had already spent ‘many thousand scudi’A For this purpose.be chose the recently begun Theatine church of S. Andrea della Valle, which was much patronised by the Florentine colony in Rome.6 His architect, Matteo Castelli, was certainly more worthy than distinguished and he worked in a style that was becoming increasingly common: its effectiveness depended on the use of sumptuously coloured and polished marble as had been introduced by
Sixtus V in S. Maria Maggiore and was later to be adopted by Paul V in the same

[Page 26]
basilica. Maffeo Barberini was, however, among the first to follow the fashion, and in the early years of the seventeenth century the richness and grandeur of his chapel, though smaller than those in S. Maria Maggiore, must have been startling—the more so as the church itself was only half constructed. Moreover, Barberini took a deep personal interest in the decoration,1 and the final result when completed many years later reflected the fastidiousness of his taste. The quality of the detail is exceptionally high and the harsh, strident and over brilliant colouring of other patrician chapels is notably toned down (Plate 8). He was reluctantly compelled to admit that Federico
Barocci was too old to paint an altarpiece, though he implored the artist to send him a picture for his private apartments in the palace he had acquired near that of the Farnese—
‘as long as it is by you I do not mind what the subject is’.2 Instead he turned to his compatriot, Domenico Passignani, at the time one of the most fashionable painters in
Rome. Passignani proposed that the cupola should be adorned with coloured mosaic and gilt stucco ribs, and he suggested a number of artists who would be suitable.3
Eventually, however, he himself was commissioned to cover it with frescoes of the
Virtues with angels and in the spandrels Moses, David, Solomon and Isaiah. He also painted the canvases and frescoes in the lunettes with Scenes from the Life of the Virgin, which are certainly his masterpieces.
At the end of 1604 Maffeo Barberini, by now a Bishop, was appointed Apostolic
Nunzio in Paris. He had already paid a short visit some years earlier to congratulate
Henri IV on the birth of his eldest son, and his return was warmly welcomed in France.
His three years there proved immensely important, for they determined the whole of his political outlook. With strong backing from the French he was made Cardinal in
1606 despite the death of his special patron Clement VIII. When he returned to Rome a year later he took back with him great riches (the usual reward of a nunzio who went out of his way to please his hosts), ‘un buffet de vaisselle d’argent vermeil dore pesant environ quatte cens marcs, duquel nous [Henri IV] luy avoirs faict dons’ and, as his emblem, the bees from the French royal coat of arms. The cultural effects were even more important. Years later, when he was Pope, a Venetian ambassador was to write4:
‘He has a special taste for the kind of studies which most appeal to the French, such as polite letters, out-of-the-way knowledge, poetry, an aptitude for languages... . .'
He had continued, while in Paris, with the decoration of his chapel in S. Andrea della Valle, and had also joined with his brother Carlo in buying and furnishing a palace near the Via de’ Giubbonari to match his new status. In fact, he stayed in Rome only a brief time during which, however, he argued with the greatest cogency against Paul
V’s intention to alter Michelangelo’s plan for St. Peter’s and add a nave as proposed by

[Page 27]
Carlo Maderno.1 He then moved out of Rome, first to Spoleto of which he was made
Bishop and then, in 1611, to Bologna where he went as Legate—one of the most influential posts in the papal government. After another visit to Spoleto he returned to
Rome in 1617 and stayed there for the rest of his hfe.
In Rome, Cardinal Barberini found the atmosphere very different from when he had last been settled there at the beginning of the century (he had, of course, paid repeated visits to the city in the meantime). Pope Paul V and his nephew Cardinal
Scipione Borghese were spending spectacular sums on palaces, churches, chapels, fountains and picture collections, and their example was being followed by a host of courtiers. Their main resources were devoted to St Peter’s, which had been radically transformed by the completion of the nave and façade, S. Maria Maggiore where the family chapel outdid that of Sixtus V in richness and colour, and the Quirinal Palace where teams of artists were at work on the decoration of the newly built rooms. Almost equal attention was being paid to the Borghese country houses, both on the Pincio and at Frascati.
The essential change that had occurred in the arts during the pontificate of Paul V was the abandonment of the austere functionalism that had characterised most architecture, painting and sculpture during the previous few reigns. After the beginning of the new century there was a revived delight in the texture of surfaces, the possibilities of enlivening façades through the interplay of light and shadow, a release of emotion through brilliant colour, an enjoyment of the solid body as opposed to the attenuated cryptograms of much late Mannerist painting, the exploitation of new themes such as landscapes and still lives, the re-emergence of the easel picture and lighter pagan subjects, all combined with a striking freedom from dogmatic theory and a readiness to indulge in every kind of experiment. No one played a greater part in the encouragement and enjoyment of these changes than Cardinal Scipione Borghese (Plate 5).
Though well-born, he was a man of few intellectual attainments, and characterised
—as the Venetian ambassador pointed out2—by ‘the mediocrity of his learning and a life largely devoted to the cultivation of pleasures and pastimes’. He was generally good humoured, but wholly ruthless in fulfilling his passionate love of art. He obtained 105 pictures—including a number of Caravaggios—by having them confiscated from the unfortunate painter Cavalière d’Arpino, who was in difficulties with the tax collectors
—and this despite the fact that d’Arpino was among the artists whom he himself often employed3; Raphael’s Deposition was, on his orders, stolen from the Baglioni family chapel in Perugia and removed by night to his collection; Domenichino was imprisoned because he had the rashness to abide by his contract with Cardinal Aldobrandini, who had commissioned from him a Hunt of Diana which Scipione coveted. (Plate 7).4 By these and more orthodox means Cardinal Borghese managed to accumulate a wonderful

[Page 28]
collection of paintings which, to the modern eye, appears to have been formed on no guiding principle other than an enthusiastic and undiscriminating appetite. Old masters, the Bolognese of every tendency, Caravaggio, Rubens, the elder generation of Mannerists—all were amply represented in his collections. His villa on the Pincio—the ‘delizia di Roma’—set in an extensive park and enriched with niches and statuary like some fantastic confectionary was the centre of the most hedonistic society that Rome had known since the Renaissance (Plate 6). Indeed, astonishing as were Scipione’s actual commissions to Guido Reni (who painted his fresco of Aurora for one of the Cardinal’s casini), to Bernini and to innumerable other artists, the very example of his way of life and carefree patronage were even more important in bringing about a new era.
In 1621 Paul V died, and after a short conclave was succeeded by the old and ill
Gregory XV. Quite suddenly everything changed. The cardinals who had flocked to
Scipione’s sumptuous banquets, the artists, retainers and sycophants who had thronged his halls, all deserted him. He was left alone and bitter among the treasures that had testified to his riches and enthusiasms—such drastic changes of fortune were now regular features of the Roman scene.1 The new Pope and his vigorous young nephew Ludovico
Ludovisi monopolised the finest talents, and, inevitably, gave their Bolognese compatriots Domenichino and Guercino complete supremacy. But now there was a definite policy to replace the cheerful chaos of Borghese patronage. Holding the influential post of Secretary of State was Monsignor Agucchi, also a Bolognese.2 A man of wide learning and a theoretical cast of mind, he was highly selective in his love of painting and convinced that princes must be guided by men ‘of enlightened knowledge’ (such as himself) in their encouragement of it. He had watched Annibale Carracci at work in the Farnese palace and befriended his young pupil Domenichino. From his contacts with these artists, from his reading of literary criticism, especially Aristotle, and, no doubt from the promptings of his own temperament, he had sketched out a theory of art during a period of retirement from public life between 1607 and 1615. In this he rejected the views attributed to Caravaggio and his followers that painting consisted
‘merely of the imitation of nature’. Rather it must aim at an ideal exemplified most fully in the works of the ancients, of Raphael and of his young Bolognese proteges.
Now, in power, he had the chance for two brief years to assert these views. Domenichino was given every encouragement, and Guercino’s painterly exuberance showed signs of modification. A brief ‘classic’ reaction set in after the wide tolerance of the previous
-- twenty years.3 If the immediate results were too few to be very noticeable, the longterm impact was none the less of the greatest importance.
Other patrons besides the Popes and their nephews were active and influential in
Rome. The corrupt and sophisticated Cardinal del Monte, representative of the Grand
Duke of Tuscany and living in the splendid official residence behind the Piazza Navona, was now (in 1617) an old man of 68—described a few years later as ‘a living corpse . . .

[Page 29]
given up entirely to spiritual matters, perhaps so as to make up for the licence of his younger days’.1 At the beginning of the century he had, indeed, lived largely for pleasure
—banquets, theatrical entertainment, parties ‘where, as there were no ladies present, the dancing was done by boys dressed up as girls’. This side of his life had been reflected in a series of canvases of effeminate young boys by Caravaggio, whose first serious patron he had been and who had lived in his household.2 But long after Caravaggio’s death and right into old age Cardinal del Monte had continued to explore the studios for new artists of talent. He launched the landscape painter Filippo d’Angeli (Napoletano)3 and shortly before dying he used his overwhelming influence on the Committee in charge of decorating St Peter’s to obtain an important commission for the virtually unknown Andrea Sacchi, whom he had employed in his casino near the Piazza del
Popolo.4
The Marchese Vincenzo Giustiniani (Plate 17b), the exceedingly rich son of a
Genoese nobleman, was meanwhile filling his palace near S. Luigi dei Frances! and the country house at Bassano di Sutri, which he himself had helped to design, with antique sculpture and one of the most remarkable collections of paintings in Rome.5 He and his brother Benedetto had been among Caravaggio’s most enthusiastic supporters, and
Vincenzo continued to employ some of Caravaggio’s Northern followers after the master himself had died. In the ‘large room with old pictures’ in his palace were hung thirteen by Caravaggio—by far the largest group in existence—along with others by the
Carracci, the great masters of the Venetian High Renaissance and by Luca Cambiaso, the Genoese painter whose experiments with lighting may well have seemed to anticipate those of Caravaggio. Most of these paintings were religious, but set apart, on the advice of the German Joachim von Sandrart, behind a special curtain, was the one that most appealed to its proorictor—the winged, yet all too human, Cupid sitting on a rumpled bed and scornfully trampling on all those symbols of culture that Giustiniani was so keenly fostering. This remarkable picture, with its sophisticated eroticism, was the only one to suggest that Giustiniani shared Cardinal del Monte’s specialised interest in Caravaggio.
Vincenzo Giustiniani showed by the arrangement of his pictures that he placed contemporary art on the very highest level and their variety makes it clear that his taste, like that of all patrons at the time, was wide and catholic. Indeed he even wrote an essay to theorise his eclecticism and show that he was prepared to see the finer points in a number of different styles. And yet his taste, as revealed in his actual collection
For Giustiniani see the inventory of his pictures published by Salerno, i960; and also the articles by Paolo Portoghesi, M. V. Brugnoli, Italo Faldi and I. Toesca in 1957. The work on the Giustiniani by
Carlo Hopf which Dr. Salerno and other investigators have been unable to trace was published in the
Giornale Linguistico, Genoa, in 1881 and 1882. It is of no importance for the Marchese Vincenzo.

[Page 30]
rather than in his writings, was far more clearly defined than that of anyone else of his age. Almost alone, and with the perception that usually comes only from hindsight, he realised the full implications of the artistic revolution that had occurred at the end of the sixteenth century. The elder generation of Mannerists, the Cavalière d’Arpino,
Federigo Zuccari, Passignano and others who still played a notable part hi the artistic life of the city, were scarcely represented in his palace, while all his attention was concentrated on the great reformers Caravaggio, the Carracci and their followers.
Giustiniani gave a special welcome to Northern artists in Rome, many of whom lived in his palace. He himself had travelled in the Low Countries during a four-month trip to Northern Europe in 1606, accompanied by the painter Cristoforo Roncalli, known as Pomarancio.1 The two men had visited churches and private collections and discussed pictures and landscapes with an acuteness and expertise that were quite exceptional at the time. On his return Vincenzo Giustiniani had the broadest and most deeply experienced artistic culture of any man in Rome and indeed Europe—with the single exception of Rubens.
Cardinal Barberini meanwhile maintained a great household and lived splendidly.
He moved, above all, in a circle of writers, scholars, scientists and poets, and engaged in a learned correspondence with the Provençal antiquary Peiresc.2 He decorated his palace with paintings—by old masters such as Raphael, Correggio, Andrea del Sarto,
Giulio Romano, Parmigianino and others3—and he also commissioned modern pictures by Guido Reni, who had worked for him during his legateship in Bologna,4 and by
Pomarancio from whom he acquired a Jacob and the Angel.5 A group of Florentine sculptors was completing the decoration of his family chapel in S. Andrea della Valle, among them Pietro Bernini. Maffeo Barberini was quick to appreciate the genius of his son Gian Lorenzo, and he was among the first men hi Rome to commission a work from him—a St Sebastian, designed originally for his chapel, but in fact retained hi the palace.6 But such recognition was as yet of little use: a sculptor as brilliant as the young
Bernini soon showed himself to be could only be employed by the most powerful families in Rome, and the Barberini could not aspire to that claim. Above all the reigning Pope Paul V and his nephew Scipione Borghese and then, after 1621, the
Ludovisi monopolised Bernini’s output. Maffeo had to bide his time and content himself with writhig witty moralising epigrams in Latin on the sculptor’s group of
Apollo and Daphne and holding up the mirror for him to carve his own features as David.
- As he did so he must already have been planning that when the moment came he would certainly put the sculptor to more spectacular use than such essentially minor though pleasing works.
