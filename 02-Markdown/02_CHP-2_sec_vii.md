In 1641 the War of Castro broke out. The final consequences of this absurd dispute with the Duke of Parma were insignificant, but its effects on the Barberini were of great

[Page 59]
importance. All the latent hostility aroused by their twenty-year rule came to the surface and almost overwhelmed them. Troops marched on Rome, there was financial panic in the city, patronage suffered disastrously. A humiliating peace was imposed in
1644; a few months later the Pope died.
Giambattista Pamfili, who became Pope Innocent X in September 1644, was elected partly through the support of the two Barberini Cardinals after attempts to promote.the cause of their friend GiuEo Sacchetti had sailed. Though there was every likelihood that Pamfili would reverse the foreign policies of Urban VIII, they were more concerned with their own security than any such consideration, and hoped that by backing the winning side they stood a good chance of survival. In this they were mistaken. An enquiry into their financial administration of the War of Castro was threatened. To avoid it Cardinal Antonio disguised himself as a sailor and fled to
France in September 164.5. Four months later he was joined by his two elder brothers
Francesco and Taddeo. In Rome their palaces were taken over, their property confiscated, and Taddeo’s wife (very soon to be a widow) was left penniless.1
The exile of the Barberini was a terrible blow to artists. Romanelli, indeed, wrote to Cardinal Francesco that ‘it is impossible for one who has until now lived under the noble patronage of Your Eminence and has received so many favours, to live far from
Your Eminence’, and he joined his patron in France.2 Bernini himself suffered for a time from his close association with the hitherto all-powerful family, and rivals and enemies such as Borromini and Algardi saw their opportunities and took them gleefully.
Yet even from a distance the Barberini managed to make their presence felt, though on a drastically reduced scale. While Francesco wrote from Paris that ‘of the painters here none is better than Vouet’,3 Bernini at last completed the tomb that Urban
VIII had so wished to see during his lifetime, and Angelo Giori, who was in charge, wrote to the exiled Cardinals and suggested that they should congratulate the artist.4
Meanwhile weavers continued work on a series of tapestries illustrating the life of Christ taken from cartoons that the Barberini had commissioned from Pietro da Cortona.5
And then, only three years after the disaster, occurred one of those reversals of fortune so frequent in seventeenth-century Rome. In February 1648 Cardinal Francesco, after some negotiations, returned and was warmly welcomed by the Pope. Artists in
Rome were overjoyed and when Antonio arrived in 1653 the brothers characteristically celebrated the occasion by ordering from Pietro da Cortona a picture of Xenophon sacrificing to Diana after his return from exile, a subject chosen by the Cardinals from the
Anabasis to commemorate the restoration of their fortunes.6 The theatre opened once more and Giulio Rospigliosi resumed work on his librettos.
Yet though the Barberini were back again their patronage of the arts was inevitably

[Page 60]
only the shadow of what it had been. Pietro da Cortona was much in demand with the new regime; and Sacchi to whom Cardinal Antonio remained loyal was becoming increasingly reluctant to paint anything at all. Indeed he shocked his envious fellowpainters by refusing to fresco the vault of S. Luigi dei Francesi as commissioned by
Antonio, who wished by this gesture to show his gratitude to the French for appointing him their Protector in Rome.1 When Sacchi died in 1661 Antonio turned to his pupil
Carlo Maratta. That artist carried on painting a series of Apostles which Sacchi had scarcely begun at the time of his death,2 and also recorded his patron’s features in some of the finest Roman portraits of the whole century (Plate 3b).3 Old and rather feeble, yet immensely grand in lais full Cardinal’s regalia, deep red echoing deep reds in the background, he stands solemnly erect at a table and gazes at the spectator. His hand points not at the small carved crucifix to his left but at the Ordre du Saint-Esprit hanging on his breast; the very embodiment of declining power. In the last years of his
Use Antonio became increasingly attached to the Jesuits to whose noviciate church of
S. Andrea al Quirinale he made large contributions. More and more of his time was spent in France—where he was given several important posts, including the Archbishopric of Rheims—but after a bout of ill-health he returned to Rome to die in 1671.
Francesco outlived him by eight years. The divergence between their tastes continued into old age, accentuated perhaps by their political differences as the elder brother’s sympathies moved further and further away from France after his return from exile.4
Francesco, as always, showed a love of colour and of richness that was alien to the more classically minded Antonio. He befriended Velasquez when the great Spanish painter came to Rome in 1650, but it is not certain whether or not he had his portrait painted by him.5 Romanelli, whose attachment to the Barberini cause was rewarded by the gift of a country-house, continued to paint for Francesco. In particular he produced two large canvases of The Marriage ofPeleus and Bacchus and Ariadne shortly before dying, in virtual retirement, in 1662.6 In the next year Francesco began an important project whose completion he was not to see. He commissioned from Lazzaro Baldi and Ciro
Ferri drawings and cartoons for a set of twelve tapestries designed to illustrate the main events of the life of Urban VIII.7 The work lasted for more than twenty years mainly
Jt will be seen that the version reproduced here, from the collection of the Duke of Northumberland, is rather different from the one described above.

because Francesco insisted on using wool only from his own flocks. So for the last time
Urban VIII was commemorated in the grand Baroque style (though now only feebly reflected) which he had done so much to promote—acquiring Urbino for the Church, fortifying Rome, receiving the homage of the Christian world... . . This commission with its nostalgic yet eloquent echoes from the past in some ways symbolised the position of Francesco Barberini during the years after his return from exile. The love of art and learning remained as deep as ever—he continued to build up his marvellous library and corresponded with scholars all over Europe1—but inevitably he played little part in the more vital culture of the day. The artists he employed were mainly those of an earlier generation; while Bernini, who owed so much to the patronage of his family, was now transforming Rome for new dynasties and new generations. And although the Barberini were represented in the patronage of younger artists—notably by Prince
Maffeo, son of Taddeo2—a real estimate of their contribution to seventeenth-century art must be based on the period of their supreme power during the pontificate of
Urban VIII.3
