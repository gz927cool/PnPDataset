THE PRIVATE PATRONS
HERE were other sources of patronage besides the papal court and the religious
Torders. Rome teemed with amateurs and virtuosi of all kinds, each with his gallery of pictures and antiques which were eagerly visited by the foreign travellers who flocked to the city. The vast majority of these private collectors were content to follow the general fashion set by the court. It would be wholly tedious to discuss in detail the innumerable cardinals, princes and private citizens who accumulated works of art during the seventeenth century—though it is painful to have to refrain from considering figures such as the engagingly named Jacopo Ghibbesio, a university professor born of English parents, with a facility for writing poetry in six languages and the enthusiastic owner of many paintings and drawings by Pietro da Cortona.1 A few men, however, stand out as being of real importance in the artistic life of the city—either because their towering wealth made them indispensable to the painters who swarmed into Rome from all over
Europe or because a firmly held and sometimes eccentric taste led these artists into unexpected channels.

3 This famous letter (Bottari, VI, p. 121) was published for the first time by the Abate Michele Giustiniani in 1675 (III, p. 417). It is undated but is always assumed to have been written in the 1630s because of a strange reference to Romanelli who only emerged as an independent artist at about that time. When reprinting this letter in 1951 (Paragone, 17, p. 50) Roberto Longhi made a wholly convincing emendation and changed Romanelli to Pomarancio. Benedict Nicolson plausibly suggested to me (verbally) that the error arose through a copyist substituting Romanelli for the similar word Roncalli (i.e. Pomarancio). This artist was Giustiniani’s special painter and his exclusion from the list would be most surprising. We can now date the letter much earlier in the century—probably well before 1620.
