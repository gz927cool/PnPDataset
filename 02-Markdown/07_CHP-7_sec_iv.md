Despite the considerable impact of Spain, and even of France, on Italian artists, it was in the Holy Roman Empire and then England that the true successors of the great
Italian patrons were to be increasingly found as the century drew to a close.

[Page 193]
The Thirty Years War had devastated much of Central Europe, but though
Vienna, the capital of the Hapsburg Empire, had been threatened with military occupation, it finally emerged in 1648 unscathed if greatly impoverished. The royal collections, however, had been housed in Prague, where they had been looted by Swedish troops for the ultimate benefit of Gustavus Adolphus’s daughter Christina. Quite soon the effects of this disaster were mitigated by the return from the Netherlands, where he had been Governor, of the Archduke Leopold Wilhelm with the marvellous pictures he had acquired there, some of which came from the gallery of Charles I. The Archduke was especially fond of the Venetian painters of the early sixteenth century and one of the contemporaries whom he most patronised was Pietro della Vecchia, part of whose reputation depended on his forgeries of Giorgione.1 He also persuaded the most successful Venetian painter of the day, Pietro Liberi, to come to Vienna in 1658 and stay there for a year during which he painted a large number of pictures and was -made Count
Palatine in return.2 On his death in 1662 the Archduke left all his possessions to his nephew, the Emperor Leopold I.
Leopold, who ruled from 1658 to 1705, was a keen but fitful patron who like his predecessors found it natural to turn to Italy for artists. His father had summoned the architect Lodovico Ottavio Burnacini, and Leopold commissioned from him a new wing for the royal palace and a succession of the most magnificent stage sets ever seen in Central Europe (Plate 28b). It was the theatre, in fact, which remained the centre of
Italian influences, for Vienna was still a fortified town under constant threat from the
Turks, and little large-scale building or decoration was yet possible.
Another dynasty that recovered with some speed from the effects of the Thirty
Years War was that of the Wittelsbachs in Munich. Their positionhadbeenstrengthened by the Peace of Westphalia, and when, in 1652, the Elector Ferdinand Maria married
Adelaide Enrichetta of Savoy they found themselves allied to the most astute ruling family in Europe.3 But Adelaide Enrichetta was also a keen lover of art and surrounded herself with a number of painters and architects from Italy. She failed in her attempt to attract Guarino Guarini, but in 1662 the Bolognese architect Agostino Barelli came to
Munich and built a church for the Theatines, based on the Roman prototype of S. Andrea della Valle, and also the central block of the royal palace at Nymphenburg.
He was followed by an architect of far greater versatility, Enrico Zuccalli, who, under the new Elector Max Emmanuel, was commissioned in 1712 to build a ‘Versailles’ at
Schleissheim. A number of Italian painters, of whom the best known are Pietro Liberi,
Antonio Triva and Pietro Bellotti, were also employed at Munich during the three decades that followed the end of the Thirty Years War. -
Everywhere the pattern was much the same: autocratic rulers, intoxicated by the idea of Versailles, deprived of native talent and desperately anxious to make up for the

[Page 194]
glories of the Renaissance which had passed them by or been cut short by strife, all turned southwards. By 1669 Johann Georg III of Saxony was employing an Italian painter called Stefano Cadani at Dresden1; in 1674 an Italian architect Arrighini built a theatre for Georg Wilhelm, the last Duke of Celle. Whole families of painters and craftsmen such as the Carlone moved into Germany and wandered from court to court.
' As yet these men tended to be only mediocre artists, but from the 1680s onwards several dozen German principalities were rich enough to attract the attention of the foremost
Italian painters. So extensive and influential did this German patronage then become
- that there is little room here for doing more than recording its scope and indicating briefly its effect on Italy.
There can be no doubt that this was decisive for the very existence of painting.
Three cities—Rome, Bologna and Venice—were principally affected by this new source of patronage, but all over the peninsula painters were devoting more and more of their labours to German princes, and in some cases almost the whole of their output was sent north of the Alps. The Liechtenstein family, which had been greatly enriched by the expropriations that followed Protestant defeats in the Hapsburg dominions, ordered forty-two paintings from the Bolognese Marcantonio Franceschini alone.2 At Pommersfelden in Franconia the Schônborn family commissioned pictures from Antonio
Balestra and Gregorio Lazzarini in Venice; Carlo Maratta, Benedetto Luti and Francesco
Trevisani in Rome; Luca Giordano and Francesco Solimena in Naples; Carlo Cignani in Bologna.3 It was—and often still is—in the palaces of patrons such as these, rather
- than anywhere in Italy itself, that representative collections of Italian late Baroque
" painting could be found. It is by comparison with Vienna, Pommersfclden and Vaduz that a certain provincialism in Roman patronage becomes apparent, for no pope or cardinal could'now hope to assemble pictures from such a wide variety of sources and over such a long period of time.
As the money, gold chains and titles poured down upon them, these Italian painters were faced with certain new problems. Their patrons were still mostly Catholics, and large-scale altarpieces or devotional pictures were easy enough to provide. But lack of direct contact with their German employers left them with some added responsibilities.
- ‘As for the subject,’ wrote tire Prince of Liechtenstein to Franceschini in a fairly typical letter,4 ‘I leave that to your good taste: perhaps a Flora with a few putti would be a good idea; or some figure representing Spring: in any case something that alludes to gardens.’ Above all they were expected to send nudes... There is no doubt that a careful and full-length study of the subject would reveal countless nuances of taste among the various German princes and show that some were far more discriminating than others; but a superficial survey such as the present indicates only an intense preoccupation with the erotic. ‘Tutte le pitture che intrano questa

[Page 195]
galleria, son mondane’, wrote the Prince of Liechtenstein in 1691/ and he proceeded to elaborate: ‘Carlo Cignani has painted a Bacchanal, a beautiful picture; Carlo Maratta a Bathsheba; Baccinelli a Susanna; Piola a Vanità; Carlo Loth one of Lot and his Daughters;
Fumiani a Christ driving the Jews from the Temple; Peter Strudel a Tarquin and Lucretia and a Joseph.’ A generation later Lothar Franz von Schonborn wrote to much the same effect: ‘Une Souzanne et la Pudiphar seroit assez de mon gout; quant a la nudité je ne m’en scandalise pas trop dans les peintures, pourvue quelles ne soit obscène, et qu’il n’y ayet pas des actions ou gesticulations infâmes, et comme j’ay observé que le plus fort de
Strudel consiste in dem nakenden, allso muss man ihn davon nicht abhallten outre qu’un beau corps et visage de femme orne bien un tableau.’2 Every other German patron would have agreed with this sentiment and under their impact the female nude played a more important rôle in Italian painting during the half-century after 1670 than ever before or since. One artist especially, Guido Cagnacci, devoted much of his career to satisfying the demand. After coming to Venice from his native Romagna he was summoned to Vienna in 1657 and there poured out a stream of Cleopatras and Lucrezias whose virginal and immature bodies undergoing outrages of various kinds added a note of sophisticated perversion to what had long been a familiar repertoire (Plate 28a).
Many other painters were interested in the same market, though they tended to have a less equivocal approach. ‘As he had a special gift for painting pretty naked women, he attracted all the best amateurs,’ we hear of Gregorio Lazzarini, who sent much of his output to Germany.3 So too did Carlo Cignani, of whom we are told that in his youth he painted ‘subjects which were too alluring (tenere) and dangerous for lascivious men’.4
But this was a small price to pay for uninterrupted German order books.
Compared to the torrent of commissions that came from Germany and Austria, the impact of England upon Italian art was almost negligible before 1700. But in the next century it was to be so important that some outline of the earlier stages must be given here.
After coming to the throne in 1660, Charles II made a few attempts to recover those of his father’s pictures that were still available, but his motives were based more on fdial piety than on any love of painting. He certainly showed no interest in contemporary
Italian art, and when, some fifteen years after his accession, the painter Antonio Verrio entered his service he was employed with little discrimination... Verrio, like Gentilcschi before him, came to England from Paris, though he had been born in Lecce and liked to call himself a Neapolitan. In common with the other artists employed by Le Brun at Versailles, he had there been required to lose rather than develop a personality, but in his case the process cannot have been a difficult one. He was brought over by the Ambassador and introduced to the King by his first English patron Lord Arlington in about 1675/ His earliest royal picture—A Sea triumph, being

[Page 196]
a large piece with King Charles II in it—was flattering if hardly very relevant to Charles’s rule so far, and from then onwards he was much employed on a series of frescoes at
Windsor designed to illustrate the extreme theories of later Stuart absolutism. In their possibilities of fulfilment these bore as much relation to the claims of Charles I as did the art of Verrio to that of Rubens. Basing himself partly on what he had learned in
France, Verrio did, however, tardily introduce into England a type of Baroque decoration that had not hitherto been seen there. Whole ceilings were covered with illusionistic fresco and walls appeared to open up to the sky. The work was mediocre, but stylistically it brought this country into line with European developments.
Another Italian artist who came to England at about the same time as Verrio was
Benedetto Gennari from Bologna.1 He was the nephew of Guercino whom Charles I had tried to entice some fifty years earlier and he too was working in Paris, where he had enjoyed a certain success. We are told that in England he earned a regular salary of 500 a year and that he was given so many commissions from the King and Queen that he couldscarcelyfulfd those from other patrons ‘not only for portraits but for other subjects more suitable for a good painter’. Some of these brash mythological paintings, heavily tinged with eroticism, have survived and we can see that in them he followed the current
French practice of portraying his sitters in the guise of some ancient heroine or deity.
For a short time after 1685 James H’s attempts to restore CathoEcism to England led to an unprecedented demand for the work of these Italian artists. Gennari turned from Danae or Elizabeth Felton as Cleopatra to altar paintings, and in combination with
Verrio, Christopher Wren and Grinling Gibbons he helped to put into effect in
Whitehall the most full-blooded Baroque decoration ever seen in an English church.
But this could scarcely last, and in 1688 Gennari was compelled to leave ‘quel funesto paese’ and return to France and eventually Italy, having acquired abroad ‘a new style which devoted special care to the rich decoration of his royal sitters’.
Verrio was more cunning. With his coach and horses, parmesan cheese, bologna sausages, olives and caviar, he left the court and worked for a time in a number of country houses. Before the end of the century, however, he had been taken up by the new regime and was being employed at Hampton Court, where in à complex allegorical fresco, whose subject was chosen from the writings of Julian the Apostate, he portrayed the triumph of Wifliam III over the Catholic powers led by France (Plate 29)? Even in an age used to changing allegiances his career was remarkable. Within little more than a generation he had put his art at the service of Louis XIV and his greatest enemy
William III; he had painted the most Catholic and the most anti-Catholic programmes ever seen in this country; and he had been required to figure the 1st Earl of Shaftesbury in the guise of Faction and then take advice from the 3rd Earl, his grandson, in depicting the Protestant virtues. He lived on until 1707, receiving a pension from Queen Anne,

and was doubtless there to greet the Genoese artist Niccolò Cassana whom she employed as her portrait painter until his death in 1714?
But in the long run the patronage of English royalty is of little consequence compared to that of the tourists who flocked to Italy in increasing numbers during the second half of thè seventeenth century. At first the majority of these were interested only in their own likenesses (Plates 30a, 30b, 31a): thus Thomas Killigrew, the playwright, James Altham, an artist, and Sir Thomas Baines, a medical student, each had his portrait painted by a leading artist in Rome, Naples and Florence.2 The few men who were detained in Italy on business were more enterprising. Baines’s friend, John.
Finch, who was Resident in Florence between 1665 and 1670, commissioned a number of religious pictures from Carlo Dolci and gave some of them to the royal family.3
And there are other collectors on this scale.
- Somewhat later two men especially stand out for their far more extensive patronage of Italian artists. Sir Thomas Isham, a gentleman from Northamptonshire, left England in October 1676 and spent nearly eighteen months in Italy, where he visited most of the important towns with his tutor.4 Though he enjoyed a series of extravagant love affairs and got heavily into debt, he also managed to acquire a certain number of contemporary paintings, advised mainly by a dissolute priest called Buno Talbot. All his commissions were given in Rome and, apart from copies of famous works by Raphael, Guido Reni,
Poussin, Pietro da Cortona and others, they included mythological pictures by Ludovico
Gimignani, Giacinto Brandi and Filippo Lauri, as well as his portrait by Carlo Maratta (Plate 31b). -
The 5th Lord Exeter'was a collector and patron on a far larger scale.8 He was in
Italy on two occasions between 1680 and 1685 and he commissioned paintings in all the cities he visited. In Florence he ordered nine from Carlo Dolci and fifteen from Luca
Giordano, who was engaged on his frescoes in the Palazzo Riccardi. These two artists, whose contrasting qualities of gentle, sweet, primitive restraint and dashing virtuosity were glaringly obvious, seem to have been his favourites, and this in itself tells us much about the breadth—or inconsistency—of his taste. In fact Lord Exeter, coming from an England still largely bereft of Italian painting, proved himself a glutton for every kind of aesthetic experience. In Venice he bought Liberis; in Bologna, Lorenzo Pasinelli; in
Genoa, Piola, Assereto and Valerio Castelli; in Rome, Maratta, Brandi, Gaulli and
Calandrucci. No Englishman had ever commissioned contemporary Italian painting on such a scale before; few were ever to do so again. He also persuaded the FrancoItalian sculptor Pierre Monnot to make a tomb for him6 and when back again at

[Page 198]
Burghley, his country house, he took advantage of the circumstances that compelled
Verrio to leave the court and employed him to paint ceiling frescoes.1
Lord Exeter played a highly significant role in the history of English collecting.
We are told that he introduced Carlo Maratta to several members of the nobility, and it is not long before the Italian biographies are full of vivid accounts of the English milordi visiting studios, paying fabulous prices and inviting artists from all over the peninsula to come and settle in England.2 It was just this indiscriminate enthusiasm that led to the theorising of the 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury, by far the most cultivated English aesthete of the day. More than anyone he welcomed and stimulated English patronage of the arts and yet he felt that the whole subject needed far more consideration than it had yet received.
His own contacts with Italian art had been intense but not always happy. He had visited Italy in 1686 when still only 15, but though he ‘acquired great knowledge of the polite arts’, nothing is known of the results.3 Then as an eager Whig intellectual, deeply sympathetic to Holland and hostile to France, he had in all probability helped to draw up the programme for Verrio’s frescoes at Hampton Court with their learned allusions to the policies of William III.4 In 1699 he sent the portrait painter John Closterman to
Rome in order to find there a sculptor capable of making for him a series of Virtues— a wholly characteristic choice of subject in a pupil of Locke and the Cambridge Platonists.5 Closterman sent him some drawings of Prudence and Justice by Domenico Guidi with a highly discouraging letter which Shaftesbury must have endorsed, for nothing came of the project. At the same time Closterman, who had already painted a full-length portrait of his patron in classical dress with volumes of Plato and Xenophon at his side, suggested that Shaftesbury himself should give the most detailed instructions to those artists he proposed to employ in the suture.
This became possible when in 1711 he was forced to retire to Naples because of ill-health. There he mixed in intellectual circles, bought pictures for his English friends and decided to put his aesthetic ideas into practice. He chose the painter Paolo de
Matteis for his experiment and gave him detailed instructions (which were later published) for a picture of Hercules at the Crossroads between Vice and Virtue (Plate 32b). The bewildered artist was made to realise all the visual and philosophical implications of the theme, for ‘the merely natural must pay homage to the historical or moral . . .
nothing is more fatal, either to painting, architecture or the other arts, than this false relish, which is governed rather by what immediately strikes the sense, than by what consequentially and by reflection pleases the mind and satisfies the thought and reason’.
Shaftesbury’s elevated ideas and his conception of the artist as a mechanical executant were not new, but they had rarely been so stringently applied to an actual creation.

[Page 199]
Nor in fact did—or could—the resulting picture betray the complex thought that had gone into its making. Though his ideas were always to be of greater interest to theorists than to artists, he himself was well satisfied with the outcome, and in 1713 he commissioned one further and deeply moving picture from de Matteis: ‘Un homme de qualité, grand d’un certain Royaume, Virtuoso, Pliilosophe, et Auteur connu par ses
Ouvrages, s’étant retire dans une certaine Ville salutaire pour se soulager de ses Fatigues, poursuit encore ses Etudes, tout malade, épuisé, et presque mourant, comme il est.’
Despite—or because of—its biographical content, the picture was to be a ‘history’ and once again Shaftesbury enclosed a rough drawing of his own to guide the artist, prescribed details down to the exact inclination of the head and insisted on examining the preliminary sketches. But this time he was too late and he died within a month of giving the order.1
Fortunately Shaftesbury had more to offer the English than doctrines which were bound to prove sterile in practice. He was one of the first to stress the role of art in
‘civilising’ society, though he extended this to the less acceptable concept that a good society would necessarily give birth to good art. And his informal writings prove that he was certainly not blind to the more emotional appeal of painting. Though the
English soon showed a strong national taste for portraiture, views and landscape at the expense of the serious history pictures which he had recommended, the extent of their collecting and patronage was in some measure due to his example and preaching.
