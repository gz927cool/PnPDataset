The conditions of art patronage in Italy had totally altered during the second half of the seventeenth century. Painters were compelled to look north rather than to Rome, and the declining prestige of the popes had thus, by a strange paradox, led to that very
Italianising of Europe which had been one of their aims in happier days. Moreover, this loss of power had, by limiting the concentration of artists in Rome, indirectly encouraged the growth of a number of active ‘provincial’ centres. Roman art, represented above all by Carlo Maratta, continued to enjoy a great reputation, but it was no longer unique, for the aspiring collector in England and Germany could, and often did, turn instead to Bologna, Venice or Naples. Artists in these cities broke through the rather stifling barriers of the tight little regimes under which they lived and sent their works as far afield as London, Paris and Vienna, Munich, Stockholm and Madrid. Crespi and
Francéschini, Luca Giordano and Solimena, Lazzarini and Sebastiano Ricci were
European favourites just as much as were Maratta and Trevisani. The very end of the seventeenth and early years of the next century saw this isolation broken down still further, for a number of complex wars brought Italy back into the forefront of international politics and disrupted a status quo that had remained largely unaltered for nearly 150 years.
In 1683 Vienna was saved from the Turks and in the following year Venice joined a Holy League with the Holy Roman Empire and the King of Poland. Then came the

[Page 200]
war of the Spanish succession. Victor Amadeus of Savoy broke loose from the tutelage of Louis XIV and after a series of tortuous' manoeuvres finally emerged as the leading independent ruler in Italy. The Austrians conquered Lombardy and seized Naples from the Spaniards. These changes, which were confirmed by the Treaties of Utrecht and Rastatt in 1713 and 1714, had their counterparts in the patronage of Italian art.
Military commanders of all the warring nations took advantage of the fleeting opportunities between campaigns to commission local talent and were served with fine impartiality by artists in many cities. There was Admiral ‘Pekemburgh’, for instance, who sailed into Genoa with a squadron of English ships sometime before 1703 and ordered his bust from the sculptor Domenico Parodi whom he then tried in vain to take back with him to England1; or the French Maréchal de Noailles who arrived soon after and was more successful in persuading Gregorio de Ferrari to come to Marseilles and paint some pictures for him there2; or the Duc d’Estrées who visited Naples with
Philip V, French candidate for the Spanish throne, and was so struck by Paolo de
Matteis that he took him back to Paris and introduced him to a number of influential nobles and bankers.3 This was an important occasion for it stimulated interest in contemporary Italian painting among some of the younger generation of art lovers who were growing tired of the ‘official’ style at Versailles.4 But hardly had Paolo got back to Naples when the city was conquered by the opposing forces and he found himself working for the English Admiral ‘Binchs’ and the Austrian commander Count Daun who had been responsible for its capture.5 Daun, who in 1707 was made the first viceroy of the new regime, rivalled his Spanish predecessors in the patronage of Italian art.
Solimena, Giacomo del Po and Paolo de Matteis all produced canvases to decorate his palace in Vienna which was frescoed by the Bolognese Marc’antonio Chiarini.
Although his first appointment in Naples only lasted for a few months, he came back for a further six years in 1713 and was one of the principal agents through whom Neapolitan painting was introduced into Central Europe—a process which was carried much
Anther after 1728 by the most cultivated of all the Austrian viceroys, Count Harrach.7
Besides these men there were a number of high commanders of Italian origin serving in the Imperial army and they were especially keen to take the opportunity of furnishing

their Viennese palaces with pictures from their native land. Thus Marshal Caprara commissioned many paintings in 'Bologna1 and, above all, the great Prince Eugene of
Savoy proved as loyal to Italy in the arts of peace as he was to Austria in those of war.
Prince Eugene was indeed the most grandiose and influential private patron in
Europe.2 His Winter Palace begun by Fischer von Erlach and the two Belvederes by
-Lucas von Hildebrandt are inspired testimonials to his passion for building; the marble
Apotheosis by Permoser which he himself designed survives as an illustration of his megalomania if not of his taste; but his collection of pictures has been dispersed. Today it is celebrated chiefly for the unique Flemish primitives it once contained; but to the
Italians of his own time Eugene was famous as a ‘generous protector and supreme lover of the sine arts, especially those of our native land...’.3 He proved this by his magnificent patronage of Italian painters and sculptors. Louis Dorigny, Marc’antonio Chiarini,
Gaetano Fanti, Carlo Carlone and others came from Italy to paint frescoes in the Upper and Lower Belvederes; Lorenzo Mattielli and Domenico Antonio Parodi made statues for the hall and gardens; Solimena sent altarpieces for the chapel. In the gallery hung pictures by Crespi, whom he employed for five years, dal Sole and many other Bolognese painters4; by the Neapolitans Giacomo del Po and Solimena, and by Vittore
Ghislandi from Bergamo.5 These are only the most famous and the list could be doubled or trebled without difficulty. From the records and inventories that have survived we gain the impression that the subjects he loved best were those taken from the ancient poets, especially Virgil, whose ‘portrait’ writing the Aeneid he commissioned from
Giacomo Antonio Boni in Bologna. His taste was above all for the sumptuous and heavy. Though he lived until 1736 he seems to have shown no interest whatsoever in the lighter manner of the Venetians, many of whom came to work in Vienna for other patrons.
For Prince Eugene was only one among a multitude of nobles who were commissioning Italian art at the time. Delivery from the Turks and then victory against the
French established the city as a great European capital—a new Rome, which rivalled the old in its appeal to artists. Domenico Martinelli came to build the town palace of the Liechtenstein family in 1691, and in 1704 Andrea Pozzo, who had been summoned by the Emperor, began to paint the ceiling of the hall in their garden palace. Mattielli made sculpture for many an aristocratic garden. Ferdinando Galli-Bibbiena produced marvellous theatrical spectacles. Painters travelling north to Germany all stopped to.
work in Vienna. And from everywhere in Italy pictures poured in to enrich the new collections that were being formed in the city. With its feudal aristocracy and allpowerful religious foundations Vienna provided a civilisation that the Italians could

understand. It was the last conquest of the Baroque in a world whose values were already changing.
Savoy was the other continental state which emerged transformed from the war of the Spanish succession and here too victory was accompanied by a wonderful flowering of the arts.1 During much of the seventeenth century the architecture of Turin had been of European significance, but patronage of painting had been almost laughable in its futility. Local talent was rare and attempts to attract artists from other towns had met with a long scries of failures. Painter after painter had refused to makejhejourney north, and successive dukes, who were in any case more addicted to hunting and military pursuits than the cultivation of art, seemed generally resigned to the situation. Now in his hour of triumph Victor Amadeus was able, with the help of his artistic dictator
Filippo Juvarra, to change all this. They followed the example of patrons in other uncreative centres and attracted leading painters, or at least their pictures, from a wide variety of more richly endowed cities. In carrying out this imaginative policy, however, they had already been anticipated in a number of smaller provincial towns and it is to them that we must turn in order to understand the significance of its origins and development.
