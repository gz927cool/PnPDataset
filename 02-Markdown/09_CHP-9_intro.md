STATE, NOBILITY AND CHURCH
-1 -
STRIKING contradiction runs through the whole of Venetian history in the
Aeighteenth century. The city was one of the greatest cosmopolitan centres of
Europe, an acknowledged resort of international tourism which the government did everything possible to promote. And yet the same government systematically tried to keep Venice as isolated as possible from foreign influences and to insulate her against’ all those forces that were changing men’s ideas of the world and that have been summed up under the general term Enlightenment. The policy was by no means altogether successful, but it was enforced with extreme rigour. Foreign ambassadors, and sometimes even ordinary travellers, were kept to themselves and refused contact with the nobility1; censorship was strict, if fitful, and prosecutions for political unorthodoxy threatened even the most highly placed2; and a law was passed in 1709, to be revived in
1783, forbidding patricians to travel abroad without special permission of the Council of Ten.3 This contradiction affected every aspect of Venetian politics and culture, and it led to a tension that was never resolved. Complaints were made about the provincialism and ignorance of the nobility,4 yet every hindrance was placed in the way of those who tried to remedy this state of affairs. Indeed some French travellers suggested that the government deliberately discouraged the sciences for political reasons, though there
The measures probably varied in severity at different times, and de Brosses sounds plausible when he says (I, p. 129) that in general nobles very rarely received foreigners. For the origins of the law see Molmenti,

is no direct evidence for this.1 Reforms were in the air, as throughout Europe, but in
Venice they were all designed to restore an earlier situation.
One preoccupation can, indeed, be felt throughout the century: a desire to preserve the status quo or, if movement was absolutely necessary, to move backwards. In the international sphere the motives for this state of mind were all too obvious. Throughout most of the seventeenth century Venice had been losing ground. The triumphs of
Francesco Morosini in the Peloponnese, celebrated with almost hysterical enthusiasm in 1686, were short-lived. In 1716 Venice just managed to withstand the siege of Corfu, but two years later, at the peace of Passarowitz, she was forced to give up all her conquests of thirty years earlier. From then on, though still extraordinarily rich despite her declining trade and though still able to Uve on past capital, she confessed herself too weak to take any further part in the struggles of Europe. Neutrality was the only hope, and quite soon many people realised that her survival depended more on the forbearance of the great powers than on her own ability to resist them. To compensate for this inherent weakness and obsessive longing for immobility the State turned to dreams of the past. It is for this reason, fully as much as for any value they might have in encouraging the tourist trade, that old traditions and customs were adhered to with such relentless fidelity. Indeed it was mainly the tourists who found such ceremonies as The Betrothal of the Sea somewhat ridiculous, though more thoughtful Venetians were also beginning to have doubts.2 The fiction that Venice was still one of the great powers was maintained with every artifice at the disposal of the State and naturally affected such painting as it commissioned. Tiepolo’s Neptune paying Homage to Venice is the most perfect illustration of this frame of mind (Plate 42a). Though painted in about 1745 when Venetian trade was causing nothing but concern, the picture expresses only the most entire self-confidence.3 Veronese, the supreme personifier of triumphant
Venice, provided the inspiration, as he did for so much eighteenth-century Venetian painting, but despite this harking back to past glories, the picture is in no sense nostalgic.
Tiepolo was indeed outstanding in his day in that almost alone, quite wholeheartedly and without a tremor of doubt, he really believed in the Venetian ancien regime. It is surprising that the State failed to make more use of him beyond driving him against his will to Madrid as a gesture of appeasement towards Spain. In fact, however, State commissions to the arts which had earlier been of such enormous importance were virtually at an end, and it is to the State’s component parts, the leading patrician families, that the greatest artists owed their most rewarding opportunities.4

[Page 247]
The whole government and higher administration of the State were in the hands of the nobility,-yet here too there was cause for anxiety. The Venetian constitution, once the admiration of Europe, was by the beginning of the eighteenth century under heavy criticism from abroad.1 Noble families, whose history and fortunes depended on trade, had long since drawn their incomes from the land. The divisions between rich and poor families became critical and soon began to endanger the stability of government. Yet despite this—or, perhaps, because of this—resistance to any change in the constitution became stronger than ever. While the wealthier nobles were increasingly monopolising all the leading positions in the administration, the poorer patrician families, alternately depending on and plotting against their more fortunate relations, agreed with them on one point only: there must be no widening of the basis of government. Yet as the resources of the State drained away during the seventeenth-century wars against the Turks, the Senate was, in fact, compelled to admit more and more new families, who were allowed to buy themselves into the nobility.2 These more recent nobles, who were often treated with contempt by the older aristocracy and who were excluded from the more important spheres of the administration, had one aim: to disguise their mercantile origins and to integrate themselves into the existing order of things. They were hardly likely, therefore, to introduce any radical ideas into society, and the conservative tone of Venetian life soon became a byword: ‘à Venise il suffit qu’une coutume soit ancienne pour être toujours suivie . . .’.3
The Church, as will become apparent later, was also governed entirely by the nobility and was maintained with the greatest splendour only at the price pf absolute submission to the State. And although the formation of a rich bourgeoisie was the natural consequence of the nobles’ withdrawal from trade, it never acquired any political power or autonomous culture. Its natural spokesmen either left Venice like Goldoni or, like Gasparo Gozzi, his keen admirer, became no more than the hangers-on of the more intelligent members of the aristocracy. Thus the history of Venetian art patronage in the eighteenth century is largely the history of the various forces which moulded aristocratic tastes at different periods. These tastes were reflected in their choice of artists, subjects and styles.
The decline of State patronage of the arts inevitably meant that this function was assumed by the limited number of families who held financial power in their hands.
It was, indeed, looked upon as a necessary appurtenance of aristocratic status, and may
Venice in the Palazzo Ducale, and allegorical frescoes alluding to its virtuous government in the Antichiesetta as well as a few scattered frescoes by other artists such as Bambini elsewhere in the palace. In
1782 it ordered four paintings by Francesco Guardi to record the Pope’s visit. It also established the
Academy which is discussed in Chapter 12.
Even the more intelligent and open-minded nobles were against changes in the constitution. Thus in
1767 Paolo Renier wrote: ‘Pericoloso è introdurre dentro a corpi militari e civili cose che sentino di novità, e particolarmente in quei tali Paesi, che si trovano nel mezzo alia pace, perché la tranquillité al di fiiori, per Fordinario, li rende inquieti al di dentro’—Marcellino, p. 30, note 78.

[Page 248]
often have had little to do with appreciation or understanding. We hear of immensely rich families who began to amass their collections only upon their reception into the nobility1; and throughout the century there can have been few patricians who were not at one time or another acclaimed as glorious patrons by obsequious publishers or printsellers—a tribute rarely if ever paid to non-nobles. Whereas the most familiar of Veronese’s and Tintoretto’s paintings had been devoted to glorifying Venice, Tiepolo was employed far more to exalt individual families. Patronage in Venice had always been aristocratic, as was the system of government, and it was therefore logical enough that the aristocracy itself should feature more prominently in Venetian painting than in the art of any other nation; for the identification of the aristocracy and the State was absolute. This was the reason for those huge votive pictures which came into prominence in the second half of the sixteenth century and which showed noble patrons on almost equal terms with their divine protectors. Individual glorification was carried a stage further during the first part of the seventeenth century when artists like Maffei, in series of canvases which filled churches in Este, Rovigo and other provinces, portrayed
Venetian governors standing somewhat awkwardly in the middle of complex allegorical trappings.2 But all these are as much a homage to the State as to the individuals depicted.
So too are the paintings in the Palazzo Ducale designed to commemorate the actions of great commanders after victorious wars—reaching a climax in the triumphal arch painted by Gregorio Lazzarini, the best known painter of the day, in honour of Francesco Morosini’s short-lived successes in the Peloponnese.3 Yet during the seventeenth century a notable change had been occurring. More and more attention began to shift to the individual at the expense of the State or of God.
There was, for instance, the façade of S. Maria del Giglio, which was designed by
Antonio Barbaro, who had fought in the war of Candia, as an apotheosis of himself and his brothers, and which was erected by Giuseppe Sardi between 1675 and 1683 (Plate
41a).4 Crowning the façade stands the figure of Glory, and beneath the semicircular pediment are the Barbaro arms with the cardinal virtues on each side. Below, in the very centre, stands the fully armed Antonio, in general’s uniform, while at his feet is the urn containing his mortal remains. Eight magnificent columns give strength and prominence to this level, and on niches to each side of him are statues of Honour and
Virtue; Fame and Wisdom stand at the base of the great volutes. On the bottom storey, separated by massive sets of double columns, are Antonio’s four brothers, and on the pedestals at their feet are plans of Candia, Corfu, Spalato, Zara, Padua and Rome, where
Antonio had served as ambassador. Such was Antonio' Barbaro’s conception—devoid

os a single religious symbol. We have to go back to the Tempio Malatestiano at Rimini to find such an extraordinary glorification of Man in a place usually reserved for the divine. In fact, the motives for this particular façade had immediate political origins.
Antonio Barbaro’s conduct in the war of Candia had been somewhat discreditable, and he had been dismissed by Francesco Morosini for incompetence. He thereupon returned to Venice and did everything possible to whip up hostility against Morosini,1 and in his - will he was careful to point out that the church was situated just opposite the Morosini palace. But Barbaro’s arrogant self-justification had wider implications. Writers on the
Venetian constitution and foreign observers at about this time particularly noticed the concern of the government to prevent any single noble gaining too much power and popularity2; the façade of S. Maria del Giglio shows the background against which such concern was expressed. The reasons for this extravagant behaviour are clear enough.
The State was exhausted by long wars, but individual families were as rich or richer than ever. Admission to the nobility now depended purely on wealth. In such circumstances both old and new families were anxious to assert their various claims as vigorously as possible, and in the process they established a pattern which was later to be of great importance for the development of painting.
Throughout the last years of the seventeenth century the ostentation of the nobility was increasing dramatically. The new attitude was expressed most vividly by Leonardo
Pesaro, nephew of the Doge. Contemporaries pointed out, with some justification, that the splendour with which he surrounded himself had never been seen on such a scale before and they came to the characteristic conclusion that the greatness of his virtue could be measured accordingly.3 In 1669 he had a monument to his uncle built in the
Frari which surpassed in grandeur anything that had preceded it (Plate 41b). He continued the vast family palace, whose dramatic façade on the Grand Canal was only completed some 17 years after his death, and in 1682 he commissioned from Niccolo
Bambini a ceiling painting to represent the Triumph of Venice—the first time the theme had made its appearance in a private palace (Plate 42b).4
Old families, like the Pesaro, had all the political privileges, but the new mercantile classes who were buying their way into the aristocracy were making themselves felt more and more by the splendour of their patronage. In the provinces, at least, lavish building sometimes even proved an essential step towards gaining political status.5 At

Bassi, 1959, pp. 240-64.

[Page 250]
the beginning of the eighteenth century four or five families who had been ennobled only some fifty years earlier were in the very forefront of artistic patronage in Venice.
The Zenobio were said to be the richest family in the city.1 The palace at the Carmini which they had bought from the Morosini, one of the twelve oldest families (the socalled Apostles), was completely transformed and nearing completion by 1703. Some fifteen years earlier the French artist Dorigny had been called in to paint a series of spectacular mythological frescoes contained within a heavy and elaborate painted architectural framework of the Bolognese type with cartouches and Carraccesque nudes derived from the Palazzo Farnese in Rome. These frescoes were designed to celebrate the virtues of the family and their protection of the fine arts, which was indeed notable.
Luca Carlevarijs, the painter of views, was lodged in the palace and painted for it a series of romantic landscapes which were inserted into frames along the corridor leading to the Salone.2 Lazzarini decorated a ceiling with Ceres and Bacchus. The young Tiepolo produced some of his earliest works for them.3
The Widmann, of Carinthian origin, had a splendid palace near S. Canciano which they too were lavishly decorating with a series of large canvases by Lazzarini showing scenes from the life of Scipio Africanus4; while their country house at Bagnoli di Sopra was painted by Dorigny with frescoes of Diana and Actaeon.5
The Labia, rich businessmen of Catalan origin, had also set about building a gigantic palace which was completed in the early eighteenth century and were engaged in displaying their great wealth in as ostentatious a manner as possible.6 Throughout the i68os they were employing Lazzarini7; and they also owned the largest collection in
Venice of pictures by Luca Giordano—presumably painted for them during his visit of
(2) S. Gerolamo nel Deserto. - (3 ) La Notte.

Cochin, who was in Venice in 1750, refers to many of these pictures: Nos. 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12 (almost certainly the ones identified by him as Job and his Wife and Isaac blessing Jacob). He also mentions a Sonates, a St Peter receiving the Keys and a picture 'où sont des pasteurs, des bergères et des moutons’—III, pp. 138139-

[Page 251]
Perhaps most striking of all, the Manin from the Friuli were untiring in the decoration of palaces, country houses and churches in and around Venice1 and they thus won a reputation for nobility of soul through the expenditure of money which was to lead eventually to the election of the futile Lodovico as the last of the Doges. More than any of the other ‘new’ families they indulged in megalomaniac display. Their country house at Passeriano was approached through two colonnaded wings adapted from
Bernini’s porticos for St Peter’s.2 Their palace on the Grand Canal, wrote a correspondent in 1708,3 was so majestic that it lost nothing in grandeur when compared to the famous marvel of the Rialto which adjoined it. The value and the splendour of the decoration surpassed all expectations. The walls were covered with the richest hangings; there were tapestries derived from Raphael with scenes of the Old Testament. The smaller rooms shone with glistening mirrors like the sea in the Apocalypse—a new fashion just introduced from France and ultimately springing from Persia. In the gallery were bronzes by Giambologna and Sansovino and pictures by Giovanni da Udine and
Andrea del Sarto. As far as contemporary art was concerned, the Manin turned to
Bologna—two pictures by Cignani, the most expensive artist in Italy, and a marble
Venus by Giuseppe Mazza ‘the Phidias of Bologna’. In fact their taste was more consistent as well as more extravagant than that of other families and they employed the same team of artists, the architect Domenico Rossi and the painter Luigi Dorigny, on many of their enterprises. ‘The rooms within’, wrote a local poet about their country house,4 ‘are adorned with smooth, shiny marbles of fine colours and not with friezes of gold.’ Coloured marble (or stucco), often cut so as to imitate great, hanging draperies, was indeed the hall-mark of the Manin style and can be found in the choir of Udine
Cathedral and above all in the Jesuit church in Venice as well as in their palace and country house.
Unparalleled splendour and a love of display were of course shared by old and new families alike. ‘Richness’, observed the same contemporary who had described the Palazzo Manin with such enthusiasm, ‘is the body of nobility, which has as its soul ancient lineage and virtue.’ There was also a certain reluctance to break with the past.
The artists with the greatest success—Zanchi, Lazzarini, Balestra, Dorigny, Bambini and others—were chiefly the ones most closely linked to seventeenth-century taste, and their prestige continued long after more adventurous painters had struck out in new directions. Thus Pellegrini, Amigoni and Sebastiano Ricci, all of whom were adult in the early eighteenth century, were scarcely employed in the decoration of great palaces and became far better known outside Venice. Indeed Ricci, despite the admiration

[Page 252]
with which he was surrounded, worked surprisingly little for the Venetian aristocracy once he settled in the city and was far more employed by the court of Turin, by churches and by the English business man, Joseph Smith.
When Tiepolo first began his immediately successful career in the 1720s it was his violent, tense style that appealed. Such a style matched the subjects he was particularly required to paint: battle scenes and triumphs taken largely from Roman history,1 for many Venetian families claimed Roman ancestry—among them the Corner, for whom he is known to have worked before 1722.2 In other cases the dramatic style and subjectmatter clearly reflect Venice’s great wars with the Turks in the 1680s and again in 1715
—the last occasion when the city, and her aristocracy left their mark on European history. The most notable example of these echoes is certainly comprised by the ten large and forceful scenes from Roman history, chosen from the most patriotically fervent chronicler "of her republican virtues, L. Annaeus Florus, which Tiepolo painted for the Dolfin, his greatest patrons of the 1720s.3 They were a tremendous family in the old style.4 Daniele III, who died in 1729, served the State abroad and at home throughout his life and was considered one of the finest orators of the day. In his will he regretted that ‘God has not allowed me to see fulfilled the ideas which I had feebly conceived when serving in the Treasury to restore the economy of the State in the tranquillity of peace.... I could wish that I might be allowed to shed my blood to heal its wounds... .', and he left all his substance to the Republic on the extinction of his male line. His brother, Daniele IV, who died in the same year, was one of the most heroic commanders in the Turkish wars, both under Morosini in the Peloponnese and again in 1715.6
The Dolfin also enjoyed 2 virtual monopoly of the patriarchate of Aquileia.6 In 1698
Dionisio, younger brother of the two Danieles, was given the post and went to live in
Udine, the seat of the bishopric. Despite the bitter opposition of Austria, he soon imposed his astute, authoritative and ambitious personality on the city and left many permanent records of his thirty-six-year.residence there. In 1708 he built a sumptuous library, decorated with frescoes by Niccolo Bambini.7 and some eighteen years later he summoned Tiepolo who had just finished working in the family palace at Venice

[Page 253]
to paint frescoes in the Cathedral and his new Archiepiscopal Palace. After rather a melodramatic start on the ceiling of the staircase, the artist gradually changed his style when he came to paint scenes from the life of Abraham in the gallery and The Justice of
Solomon in the hall of the tribunal. The dark and lumpish heaviness of his earlier work was replaced by an aristocratic incisiveness of line and a whole new range of magical colours—sparkling blues and pinks and greens—set against a light airy background.
Thus, shortly before dying, Dionisio Dolfin, who ruled his petty state like some feudal bishop of the Middle Ages (the very type of patron most congenial to Tiepolo), had the privilege of seeing the first masterpieces of the greatest painter of the century.1
Indeed for Tiepolo, as for so many Venetian artists, the final break with the heavy style of the seventeenth century did not—perhaps could not—come in his native city, so conservative in temper. In the early 1730s he was frequently summoned outside
Venice and, by the time he returned, his palette had lightened still further and his subjects had changed. The heroic days of an Antonio Barbaro or a Daniele Dolfin must now have seemed almost as remote as the Roman epics with which he had commemorated them, and indeed two members of the latter family were soon in prison or in exile for breaking the most fundamental laws of the State. Venice herself was firmly neutral. But
Tiepolo remained as much in demand as ever: it is hard to resist the conclusion that his marvellous gifts and brilliance of execution created a need for his art fully as much as they satisfied it. He himself deliberately aimed at a special class of patron. He used to say that ‘painters must try and succeed in large-scale works capable of pleasing the rich and the nobility because it is they who make the fortunes of artists and not the other sort of people, who cannot buy valuable pictures. And so the painter’s spirit must always be reaching out for the sublime, the heroic, the perfect.’2
Thus it was that for the next two decades Tiepolo was working incessantly for an aristocracy that was now breaking up still further into individual components than it had been at the beginning of the century. But its ambitions were no longer military— and were soon to be scarcely even political. In 1761 the British Resident, reporting the death of the Procurator Alessandro Zen, added: ‘what is very unusual, and without a precedent, no one has yet offered for a Candidate to succeed him, tho’ one of the greatest
Dignities in this Republick . . .’.3 This situation was to become more commonplace,4

[Page 254]
but for a full generation earlier the aristocracy, in the absence of great public exploits, had had to turn to the celebration of private deeds. The nobles, in fact, took refuge in a fabulous dream world, glowing with light and colour, where marriages and family histories were turned into events of supreme importance, attended by all the deities of the pagan and even Christian religions. It was a world given imperishable existence by
Tiepolo, who recorded the more notable events in the aristocratic calendar in a scries of eulogistic allegories. And yet it was a tense and unrelaxed world, always on show, with every muscle strained to the utmost, every expression hard and humourless, for never in history has the gap between everyday Use and artistic fantasy been as great and as unbridgeable as it was in Venice during the middle decades of the eighteenth century.
In 1758, for instance, Faustina Savorgnan, a young girl of the most select nobility, married Lodovico Rezzonico, second son of a family whose rise had been as spectacular as it was recent.1 Of Genoese origin and ennobled only in 1687, their great wealth had secured them the leading positions in the State. Aurelio, Lodovico’s father, was made
Procuratore di S. Marco in 1751, and in that year bought one of the grandest palaces in
Venice from the Bon family. Seven years later his brother Carlo was elected Pope as
Clement XIII. In his marriage fresco for the Pope’s nephew Tiepolo envisages a scene which puts even these successes in the shade (Plate 43). The bridal pair are being carried on the chariot of the sun drawn by four hurtling white horses and accompanied by
Apollo himself, while Fame sounds the event to the world.
As the aristocracy declined in international importance, its glorification at Tiepolo’s hands reached new peaks. Families could look up at the ceilings of their state rooms and see their virtues of constancy, strength and justice trumpeted to the four corners of the earth. Admiring Red Indians or black savages might help to compensate for the coldness and scorn of more uncomfortable neighbours such as France or Austria. The Grassi,2 the Widmann, the Giustiniani3 and the Soderini all had apotheoses of their families painted in their palaces or country houses, and as late as 1794 when the Republic was in its final stages of decay we find the artist Pietro Novelli recording the greatness of the
Collalto.4 In their more excessive forms these frescoes showed actual portraits of living members of the family sharing in the general exaltation. Pietro Barbarigo, the leading member of the extreme Catholic faction, had his nephews included in the fresco of
Strength protecting Wisdom which Tiepolo painted for him in 1745.8 And most striking of all, appropriately enough, was the last great work painted by Tiepolo before leaving
Venice for ever—the Apotheosis of the Pisani in their country house at Stra.6 The palace was acknowledged to be the grandest built near Venice in the eighteenth century7 and
- 2 Mohnenti, 1909, pp. 177-88, attributes the fresco to Fabio Canal and unravels the iconography.

[Page 255]
for it Tiepolo designed the most extraordinary family allegory he had yet painted (Plate 44).'In this it is not the founding fathers or the great heroes who are celebrated, but the family’s living members extending to its youngest son, Almorô, seated in his mother’s lap. Actual portraits of these are shown in the ceiling while the Fatherland points out their merits to the Virgin and invokes her blessing on them. The Virgin is surrounded by the theological virtues, Faith, Hope and Charity, and by Wisdom. On the other side of the fresco flies Fame to spread the glory of the Pisani family throughout
Europe, Africa, Asia and America. The year was 1762: England had just wrested Canada and India from France, and Robespierre was aged four. - '
Such flattery—and there is evidence that in at least some cases the artist himself took the initiative in choosing the subject1—was available to any noble with the money.
A standard figure of Time could suggest that the family was old in wisdom and virtue, but the reference need not be too precise. There was, however, another kind of ancestral glorification which was necessarily confined to the older members of the Venetian aristocracy. It is easy enough to understand why the recording of specific achievements from the past should have first made an appearance when the new aristocracy was beginning to flaunt its titles and wealth, and should have proved even more attractive when refuge in that past was the only compensation for an inglorious present. Thus in
1700 the Corner commissioned Gregorio Lazzarini to paint a member of their family who had distinguished himself at the time of the League of Cambrai—Venice’s finest hour.2 And other old families followed suit—for subjects such as these were beyond the reach of a Widmann or a Grassi. It is true that the first elaborate reconstruction of an earlier period painted by Tiepolo was for the Sodcrini, ennobled as late as 1656, but they had a long and renowned Florentine ancestry which the artist was able to suggest in three scenes from the fifteenth century leading up to the climax of the family apotheosis on the ceiling.3 In much the same way he painted the Contarini at the moment of their greatest glory—the welcome they gave in 1574 to Henri III of France when he visited their villa at Mira.4 Social prestige now made a greater appeal than military prowess. '
Such family allegories were not the only way in which noble.patrons could be flattered. Sometimes the subject could be more allusive. The Sandi,- who had been
Though this may well be an apocryphal story designed to show off Lorenzi’s culture, it does at least suggest that a good deal of freedom was left to the artist. Novelli specifically tells us in his Memoirs (p. 62) that it was he himself who chose to record the Greatness of the Collalto family. Most Venetian artists of the eighteenth century first produced modelli of their proposed work for inspection by the patron and there are only a very few cases of great discrepancy between these and the completed decoration. This too suggests that the painter was not tied down too rigidly by his instructions.

[Page 256]
ennobled only in 1685,1 were among the first to employ Tiepolo, and as their fortunes were closely linked to the extremely lucrative profession of the law, they commissioned a ceiling in their palace which was to illustrate the Powers of Eloquence, as expressed in four stories from antiquity.2 Goldoni tells us in his Memoirs that lawyers enjoyed a status in eighteenth-century Venice second only to that of the nobility,3 and it is significant that one of the very few non-nobles who had the chance to employ Tiepolo was Carlo
Cordellina, the leading advocate of the day. He was a man, we are told,4 who did not
Eke useless luxury, such as loading his wife with precious stones, but who beHeved in splendid living. And so he built himself two houses, one in his native Vicenza and one in the country at Montecchio. To decorate the latter he summoned Tiepolo, who was much irritated by the extensive entertainment for which Cordellina was renowned,5 but who frescoed The Continence of Scipio and the Family of Darius before Alexander the
Great on the walls—clear allusions to the magnanimity of his patron—and the Triumph of the Arts on the ceiling.
There was a famihar repertoire of Greek and Roman stories which had been codified in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as suitable for the display of aristocratic virtues, and all subsequent artists drew heavily on it. But it is probable that such scenes may often have had far more precise meanings than are at present understood.
Not only did many patrician famines claim Roman descent, as has already been pointed out, but officials in the service of the state were used to hearing themselves compared to Roman heroes on the most trivial pretexts. Thus in 1724 when Pietro
Loredan left a neutral Venice for the fortress of Legnano of which he was commander, an orator alluded to the heroism of Mucius Scaevola6; and at about the same time another member of the Loredan family, Antonio, was, on leaving the governorship of Padua, compared to Pompey.7 The theme of Sacrifice was particularly popular, for it satisfied the century’s love of melodrama while alluding to the responsibilities of power. But antiquity also provided a fund of more exhilarating scenes. Tiepolo and his followers frequently painted The Banquet of Antony and Cleopatra, which glorified a beautiful
Eastern queen successfully challenging the rough Roman hero from the West by her astuteness and wealth; this was surely a veiled allusion to Venice’s own pohey during these years but it also symboEsed a final enthusiastic fling of aristocratic extravagance in the face of new theories of political economy which were everywhere gaining ground—a ‘reactionary’ manifesto which found its Eterary equivalent in some of the writings of Carlo Gozzi. There was, however, a more straightforward background to the choice of this theme. We learn from the memoirs of Antonio Longo

[Page 257]
that nobles used to organise competitions as to who could offer the most expensive banquets1 ; and the Labia, whose palace contained Tiepolo’s most magnificent version of the subject, became legendary for their extravagance.2 Moreover, Maria Labia, doyenne of the family and a ‘femme sur le retour qui a été fort belle et fort galante’, owned a famous collection of jewelry of which she was especially proud.3 There can be little doubt that Tiepolo intended a delicate compliment, and that Maria Labia felt no great difficulty in identifying herself with the beautiful Egyptian queen who won her wager by dissolving a priceless pearl in wine.
Unbridled dreams of power and grandeur on this scale, and the acute and genuine awareness of the Venetian nobles that (unlike their equivalents in France) they still represented the only real power in the State, kept history painting ahve in Venice at a time when it was declining in expressive force and importance throughout Europe.
‘There must be a great difference’, wrote Paolo Renier in 1772, ‘between a minister who serves his Prince as a subject and one to whom God’s special grace has granted the supreme boon of living in a free Republic and of being a small but essential part of the whole.’ Some of the moral fervour of the French middle classes, which was to lead to a revival of history painting and culminate in the rhetoric of David, was here expressed by the aristocracy and found its champion in Tiepolo—though, of course, the results were wholly different in elegance, colour and subject-matter. Indeed, curiously enough, those Frenchmen who in the middle of the eighteenth century were especially concerned to revive native history painting were keen admirers of Tiepolo. Thus in 1754 the
Marquis de Vandières (later Marquis de Marigny) wrote to the Director of the French
Academy in Rome instructing him to send students to copy the artist’s frescoes at the
Villa Contarini-Pisani, for ‘il en naîtra un autre bien pour l’histoire de France, puisqu’on aura les usages et les habillements de ces tems-là qui sont très intéressants pour elle’.5
And Cochin, who had the same interests at heart, also thought very highly of Tiepolo.6
Present-day taste finds the artist’s bozzetti more appealing and, attracted by the general glamour of ‘rococo’ art, fails to grasp the grandeur and megalomania of Tiepolo’s full-scale decorations. There is reason to believe that painters like Fragonard and some connoisseurs of the time may have made the same distinction. But admiration for
Tiepolo’s marvellous colour and fantasy should not blind us to his moral commitment to the cause he was serving any more than it does in the case of Rubens.
It was probably the Venetian nobility’s awareness of real privileges and obligations that was responsible for the exaggerated dignity of their portraiture7 and for the surprisingly small amount of that erotic and frivolous painting that was so typical of the French rococo. There is no Venetian equivalent to a Boucher or a Fragonard, and

[Page 258]
it is significant that the artists who most nearly approach the French from this point of view, Pellegrini and Rosalba Carriera, appear to have had more success abroad than in Venice. Even subjects such as Bathsheba bathing or Susanna and the Elders which had been enormously popular as pretexts for eroticism towards the end of the seventeenthcentury later became very much rarer; while mythologies such as Aurora, Flora and so on were less in demand than scenes from Roman and-Greek history. Similarly Gian
Antonio Guardi, an artist of magical but quite unserious qualities, enjoyed a relatively insignificant career, whereas in Paris he would surely have had a triumphant success.
Only very rarely did Tiepolo stray from dreams of grandeur to the world of pure enchantment. The most striking instance is in the beautiful series of frescoes illustrating romantic scenes from Homer, Virgil, Tasso and Ariosto which he painted for the
Valmarana family in Vicenza.1 Unfortunately too little is known of the circumstances surrounding the commission and of its patrons to explain this interlude in his career, but it may just be worth pointing out that we are told of Leonardo Valmarana, who seems to have been the head of the family when the frescoes were painted in 1757, that he was of a ‘sweet disposition, pleasant conversation, and the most agreeable character.
He was far removed from any display, ostentation or pride . . . being aware that true nobility does not consist in boasting of ancestors which only proves oneself to be void of merits and virtue. He was always humble in his manner, almost forgetful of his birth, his blood and his greatness’.2 The words come from a funeral oration—not the most reHable source for an impartial estimate of a man’s character—but so insistent are they in stressing a virtue not often referred to, still less praised, in eighteenth-century Venetian orations, that they are worth bearing in mind when we try and explain the exceptional nature of Tiepolo’s work at the Villa Valmarana and the rustic frescoes by his son in the foresteria there.
Amid the throngs of patricians who were decorating their palaces and villas with allegories of their virtues or scenes from their family histories there was one man who especially struck his contemporaries for his rectitude, intellectual authority and political stature. Marco Foscarini was descended from one of the oldest families in Venice.3 He was educated in Bologna and in his younger days he travelled to Paris, Vienna and
Rome, serving as ambassador in the two latter cities. In 1734 he was appointed official historiographer of the RepubHc, and though he never wrote the volumes expected of him he was always passionately interested in Venetian literature and history about which he planned a number of studies only some of which were published in his lifetime. This love of the past and constant dwelling on the ancient glories of Venice deeply affected his political thinking. As Procuratore di San Marco from 1741, and later as Doge for a few months before his death in 1763, he became increasingly identified with conservative causes, and it was he who took the strongest stand against Angelo

[Page 259]
Querini and his proposed 'reforms’ in 1762.1, Though the methods by which he became
Doge are open to suspicion, he seemed to his contemporaries to represent the last surviving incarnation of the old virtues of integrity and learning that had made Venetian
Statesmen so respected. He was indeed a proud and cultivated man and his patronage shows him to have had ambitious and scholarly tastes.
The family palace was opposite the church of the Carmini,2 and it was repeatedly decorated with great lavishness—‘the family is the richest in Venice,’ wrote one architectural painter working there in 1749,3 ‘they have 13 0,000 ducats a year and an infinite
- number of palaces and jewels and a gallery worth 200,000 ducats’. Many of the'pictures, which included seven Tintorettos and other Venetian classics, had been left with the palace by its former owner, Pietro Foscarini, himself a Procuratore di San Marco, who died in 1745?
Marco Foscarini was more interested in books than in pictures, and his main attention was devoted to his magnificent library of manuscripts and other works, mostly dealing with the history of Venice.5 The paintings he commissioned were intended primarily to illustrate his literary interests, and with one exception it is unlikely that he made use of any of the leading artists of his day. During his embassy in Rome between
1737 and 1740 he employed Pompeo Batoni, who was living, Eke him, in the Palazzo di S. Marco to draw his portrait and to paint a Triumph 0/ Venice according to a programme clearly drawn up by himself (Plate 45). It was to represent‘the flourishing state of the Repubhc when, after the wars incited by the famous league of Cambrai, peace returned and the fine arts began to flourish again in Venice, summoned back and fostered
- by Doge Lionardo Loredano’. In its harking back to the recovery of Venice after earlier disasters, the subject typifies Marco Foscarini’s desire to seek encouragement from past history. It is noteworthy too as one of the very few ‘historical’ pictures painted for a
Venetian patron which has no reference to the triumphs of his own family but is purely devoted to exalting the State. Greek sages on the right of the picture are being shown the recorded achievements of Venice by Mercury; on the left a Roman warrior has her present grandeur pointed out to him by Neptune. In the foreground, at the feet of
Minerva, are the arts; while in the centre the chariot of the Republic with Doge Loredan
- is surveyed by History and Fame. The figures of Minerva and the Roman warrior are extraordinarily classical for the period in which they were painted, and Batoni has made no concessions to Venetian taste.
We know much less about Foscarini’s other pictures, beyond the fact that they

[Page 200]
represented the great writers of Venice and hung in the rooms where he kept their books.
Many of them seem to have been painted in Rome where Marco Foscarini, whom the
President de Brosses found to be a man ‘d’un esprit et d’un feu surprenants’, did everything he could to maintain the prestige of his native city. It was in Rome too that he acquired large numbers of books and manuscripts which he brought back ‘quasi trionfando’ to the-family palace; and in both cities he employed sculptors in marble, ivory and metal to record the great figures of the past.1 All these images are now gone and we have no indication of the artists who made them. What little we know is not very encouraging. ‘He was’, wrote the minor painter Pietro Antonio Novelli,2 ‘an extremely learned prince and a great patron and lover of the fine arts... . . When he saw a S. Marco I had painted for the engraver Marco Pitteri, he liked it so much that he insisted on keeping it in his room for four days, and then wanted a history picture from me... . .' Giacomo Guarana, a follower of Tiepolo, painted frescoes in the palace3;
Giuseppe Nogari his portrait.4
The great names of Venetian painting do not seem to have played much part in his life5; but his artistic patronage none the less made a striking impression on his fellowcitizens. As you walk through lais rooms with the portraits and busts of great men, wrote a contemporary,6 ‘the emotion of elation and respect experienced by lovers of virtue is indescribable. You seem to enter a venerable sanctuary in which the most famous writers, and the very Muses themselves, have made their home.’
Enough has been said to show that certain artists at least received considerable patronage during the first half of the eighteenth century. Indeed, when he came to write of painting during this period the Abate Moschini specifically claimed that the arts had suffered from no lack of support.7 And from other sources too we learn of families employing established artists as members of their households8: thus the Pisani organised a private academy with Pietro Longhi in charge, but this seems to have done little more than provide their son Almord with drawing lessons and it came to an end with his death.9
Yet if we look rather more carefully we see that this patronage was more restricted in nature and scope than at first appears. Moschini was, after all, rebutting a charge that the arts owed nothing to Venetian support, and though this is clearly false, the type of art required was certainly very limited. Thus the patrician insistence on his own glorification inevitably led to a great concentration on the ceiling fresco. We know too
Moschini, 1806, III, p. 70).

[Page 261]
from travellers that pictures were hung on walls to fulfil a purely decorative function.
‘The Venetians cover their walls with pictures, and never think their apartments properly finished until they have such as shall fill all the spaces from top to bottom, so as completely to hide the hanging. This being their object, there are in all the collections many more bad pictures than good; and on entering a room, the number of paintings are such, that it is not till after some recollection you can discriminate those pictures that merit attention, from amongst a chaos of glowing colours that surround them; and which are frequently so ill classed, that a picture which requires to be hung high, is perhaps the lowest in the room, whilst another that cannot be seen too closej touches the cornice: this is occasioned by their great object of covering the walls, never considering what light etc. may suit their pictures.’1 By the early eighteenth century this aim had been achieved for most of the older patrician families. If we examine their inventories we are again and again struck by the fact that the commissioning or buying of contemporary pictures declined very considerably after this period.2 The last generation of artists to be adequately represented in Venetian collections is that dating from the very end of the seventeenth century. The Pisani, for instance, by far the most lavish family of the time and for some years during the youth of Almord (1740-66), himself an amateur artist, the special patron of the landscape painter Giuseppe Zais,3 bought for their palace at S. Stefano only a few pictures painted after 1720, and while the number of contemporary paintings in their country house at Stra, built in the 1740s, is much larger, it is still noticeably inferior to that of the previous century.4
The decline of art patronage during the eighteenth century was in fact much discussed at the time—T don’t find’, wrote one observer in 1745,5 ‘that these nobles like spending money on pictures’—and various reasons were given for it, most of which amounted to little more than welkworn diatribes about the corrupt state of the age.
While these can be accepted only with caution—corruption (even decadence) and the sine arts have often proved the happiest of bed-fellows—it is difficult to find more concrete reasons. New fashions in interior decoration certainly played some part in limiting the amount of wall space, and in the palaces of older families galleries were already silled with the accumulation of centuries. But these factors cannot have been decisive. The economic situation is still more difficult to assess. It is certain that many extremely important families drastically declined in wealth during the century and that money became more and more restricted to a small inner group. The Foscarini, who lived opposite the Carmini, were rumoured to be the richest family in the city and to

[Page 202]
have an annual income of 32,000 zecchini a year.1 At the very opposite end of the scale it has been estimated that bare subsistence could just be maintained on about 15 zecchini a year.2 If we compare some of the prices charged by different artists we can see that, in the most successful cases, foreign competition kept them very high. Thus at the very outset of his career Canaletto was charging about 22 zecchini a picture; within ten years he had raised his price to 120 zecchini and this was understandably considered to be exorbitant. A miniature by Rosalba Carriera cost 50 zecchini and a pastel 20 or 30 depending on whether it was to include one or both hands or flowers. Curiously enough, large history paintings and even full-scale decorations were less expensive, comparatively speaking, than the small works of fashionable artists with a cosmopolitan clientèle. Thus
Piazzetta’s large picture of the Angelo Custode was valued at about 100 zecchini, and
Tiepolo, who was himself required to pay for the canvas and pigments, was given only the same sum in 1743 for his Martyrdom of St John the Bishop in Bergamo Cathedral, and only 500 zecchini in 1754 for his frescoes in the domeof the church of the Pietà in Venice.3
The new nobles, who had to pay nearly 30,000 zecchini to be enrolled, were obviously not worried by problems of space or money, and their reluctance to buy contemporary pictures is still harder to explain. For an extensive gallery was a necessary corollary of nobility, and it is striking that the only patrician family to have built up a collection of pictures in the eighteenth century were the Grassi, who had bought their way into the aristocracy in 1699. But they seem—deliberately, perhaps, so as to emphasise their ancient lineage—-to have ignored contemporary artists altogether and to have turned instead to those same old masters who could be found in such numbers in the galleries of older families: Titian, Veronese, Bassano, Van Dyck, Guido Reni, GuerCino, Schiavone, Fetti and Rubens.4 One wonders who began to paint the ancestral portraits.
The Labia were not much more adventurous in their choice of pictures: for them too art seemed, to stop at the end of the seventeenth century, though they owned a portrait by Tiepolo as well as his frescoes, and employed Cignaroli for a time6; only the Giovanelli, ennobled in 1668, bought works by Tiepolo, Piazzetta, Canaletto and
Zuccarelli as well as old masters.
I have deliberately changed all currency into the unit of the zecchino, making use of the tables in De La Lande,
VII, p. 81. The estimate of the Foscarini income is derived from a letter of Pietro Visconti who was working there in 1749—See p. 259, note 3. 2 Berengo, 1956, p. 86.
He worked for the Labia for four years and some of the oil paintings which he inserted into ceilings in the palace are still in situ. "
‘‘Ad ornato dei mezzani di sopra,’ wrote Gio. Battista Biffi of the Palazzo Giovanelli in 1773, ‘vi sono a carra i quadri di Paolo, di Palma, di Tiepolo, di Farinato, Le tavole greche del quattrocento, e senza numero i bei pezzi originali di Tempesta, di Zelotti, di Canaletto, di Piazzetta, e del mio Zuccharelli....’

[Page 263]
Thus, apart from magnificent ceiling.decoration,.the nobility was not very imaginative in its support for the arts during the first half of the eighteenth century, and, in fact, we only find one patrician of any individuality as a patron and collector—
Zaccaria Sagredo (Plate 48b).
The Sagredo were among the oldest of Venetian families and during Zaccaria’s own lifetime they gave to the Republic one of its most impressive Doges, Niccolò, though he only lived for eighteen months after his election in 1675. There could have been no greater contrast between this decisive, haughty politician and his nephew the young Zaccaria, then aged 21. Though he too, like all Venetian aristocrats, was destined for public service, his ambitions clearly lay elsewhere, and he never achieved any higher post than the governorship of Bergamo in 1690.1 He used his considerable resources to amass a large collection of paintings, drawings, sculpture, books and armour which in his later years won him the reputation of being the greatest patron ofhis day in Venice2 and among foreign visitors that of being just about the only one. When John Breval came to the city in the late 1720s he said that he ‘could hear of but one remarkable
Dilettante, the noble Sagredo’.3 This reputation was not wholly to his liking. For
Zaccaria Sagredo seems to have been of a quite excessively nervous temperament and to have carried his scruples about meeting foreigners to an extreme. On one occasion he was seen hurrying ‘down Stairs ... as if the House had been on fire’ to avoid such a perilous contact.4 He never married, and he filled his palace at S. Sofia with paintings old and new, bought from previous collectors, commissioned directly from the artist or picked up at exhibitions.5 He made anxious though, as it proved, unavailing provision for his collection to be kept intact after his death by putting.it in charge ofhis favourite servant Tommaso de’ Santi and leaving it to his nephew Gherardo. And then in 1729 this timid, acquisitive, art-loving bachelor died. Gherardo survived him for ten years,
Keysler, who must have arrived in Venice soon after Zaccaria’s death in 1729 (Travels, 1757, III, p. 295, and Schudt, 1959, p. 69), reported that the celebrated gallery ‘consists chiefly of antiquities, natural curiosities and especially foreign arms and weapons’, but he was in fact unable to get in as repairs were under way. Cochin, III, pp. 143-50, discussed many of the pictures in the collection.
Air anonymous manuscript in the Biblioteca Correr—Cod. Gradenigo 185, cc. 379-86—called Serie delle Nobili Veneti, e Cittadini Professori di Belle Arti, e delti dilettanti raccoglitori di cose antiche, e rare,  così delti scopritori, e inventori di valevoli industrie mentions under the date 1710 ‘Zaccaria Sagredo con grandis.a spesa aveva per suo diletto proveduto a miliare di stampe, e carte disegnatela primi, e valenti uomini del mondo’.

[Page 264]
but after his death aged 49 in 1738, plans at once began to be made for the dispersal of the collection so lovingly built up.1 Horace Walpole, travelling in Italy between 1739 and 1741, heard of the proposed sale.2 So did Francesco Algarotti two or three years later.3 In fact, the collection was broken up piecemeal over a long period. Sagredo’s heirs, who were much less cautious than he had been, got in touch with anyone interested and had no scruples about selling to foreigners. Both the British Consul, Joseph
Smith,4 and his successor, John Udney, were among those who came to buy.5
The importance of the collection and its contemporary prestige can be gauged from the fact that in 1743 both Tiepolo andTiazzetta were required to draw up inventories, and were followed nearly twenty years later, in 1762, by Pietro Longhi.6 It is from their work and from general contemporary eulogies that we have to derive most of our information about Zaccaria Sagredo as a patron and collector. Unfortunately it is very difficult to 'appraise the evidence, for there were already many pictures in the family collection before Zaccaria himself added his individual contribution. Thus the battle scenes by Borgognone, which were among the most highly valued pictures in the gallery, were painted for Doge Niccolò,7 and many of the others later recorded in the palace must date from this or earlier periods.
It was not until ten years after this that Zaccaria, on the death of his father, became head of his branch of the family, but we first begin to hear of his passion for art very much later when he was already an old man.8 Even in these last years of his Use, however, Sagredo’s sympathies extended to the younger generation of Venetian artists.

Thus at one of the annual exhibitions at S. Rocco he bought Piazzetta’s Angelo Custode, a huge altarpiece which the painter had been unable to dispose of elsewhere.1 This picture was certainly the most important of his modern acquisitions. Both Tiepolo and (more obviously) Piazzetta himself agreed’in valuing it very highly when they drew up an estimate of thé collection; and Venetian and foreign visitors alike were aware of its fame.2 Zaccaria Sagredo may well have been in touch with Tiepolo himself at an early stage in the great artist’s career: an unidentified ceiling by him and several drawings were recorded in 1743, and though the former may have been commissioned after
Zaccaria’s death, the drawings were almost certainly acquired by him. Furthermore, sometime after 1721 Tiepolo drew for the engraver Andrea Zucchi the statue of
Virginity by the sculptor Antonio Corradini in the church of S. Maria del Carmelo and this was dedicated to Zaccaria Sagredo ‘who by means of his nobility, authority and generosity cherishes and promotes the fine arts’.3 Sagredo Was also among the very first patrons of Canaletto: he owned at least one view by him before the end of 1725 and he was interested enough in his career to comment on pictures painted for other clients.4
It is finally just possible that Zaccaria Sagredo commissioned a work by one other artist destined to make a great name for himself later in the century, though here the results were less fortunate. Pietro Longhi put the date 1734 on the clumsy fresco of The Fall of the Giants which he painted on the staircase of the Palazzo Sagredo, but this must refer to the completion of the work, and there is reason to believe that he began it at the outset of his career very much earlier and consequently that the commission came from Zaccaria himself.5 Certainly the old man went on collecting until the very end of his life. G. M. Crespi, who painted two religious works for him, wrote from Bologna in July 1729 that his patron’s death had been hastened by the tricks played on him by dealers. ‘He died a few days ago after having spent between seven and eight thousand zecchini on pictures and drawings, many original, most of which were not worth a piastra.’6 himself) there are some religious canvases by the German Johann Karl Loth and some portraits by Niccolò
Cassana—certainly nothing that can remotely justify the claims made for Zaccaria’s patronage in his own day. In fact it is certain that he bought many old masters which are quite impossible to identify among the many hundreds in the collection; and equally certain that as early as 1743, the date of the first inventory, many pictures had already been disposed of.
' 2.Part of the picture is now in the Detroit Institute of Arts. Cochin, IH, p. 150, who in 1758 wrote an account of the pictures then in the Sagredo palace, called it a ‘tableau fort beau’.
Zaccaria Sagredo, che con la nobiltà, autorità, beneficenza favorisce e promuove le belle arti... . .’
Crespi’s letter to Stefano Conti of 4 July 1729 is in the Biblioteca Governativa, Lucca—MSS. 3299:
‘Se cosi fatto avesse (come più e più volte pregato) l’Ecc.mo Zachario Sagredo Nobile Vèneto, la quantità degl’inganni non gli avrebbero affrettata la Morte. Mori giorni sono doppo bavere Speso più di 7000, in
8000 Zecchini in tanti Quadri, e disegni molti originali, la maggior parte che non valevano una Piastra.’

[Page 266]
Despite his probable contacts with Tiepolo, Piazzetta, Canaletto and Longhi so early in their careers and so late in his, our knowledge of Sagredo is so slight that we would scarcely pay much attention to him as patron were it not for the enthusiasm of his contemporaries. But about one aspect of his collecting we are very much better informed, and here Sagredo’s supremacy over any other aristocratic rival is so evident that it is possible for us to understand the extent of his reputation. He was a passionate collector of prints and drawings. Indeed, John Breval wrote that he ‘is reckoned to have the largest Collection of Prints of any man in Europe’, though he added rather unfairly:
‘This is the only Branch of Virtù that Gentleman is famous for.’1 In the inventories of the Sagredo collection drawn up some years after Zaccaria’s death there are many volumes of drawings which we can assume to have been assembled by him. They include works attributed to Rembrandt and thejGerman old masters as well as to contemporaries such as Tiepolo, Piazzetta, Cimatoli, Silvestro Manaigo and others. From Moschini we learn that Sagredo commissioned too views in pen and ink from the Brescian artist
Andrea Torresani2; other sources tell us that he bought at a high price ‘all the rare and very correct drawings of Lazzarini, and also bound into a volume all the drawings of the Bellunese [Gaspare] Diziani’.3
In later years these drawings were sold by Zaccaria’s heirs, and among those who bought several complete volumes was the Englishman Joseph Smith. As these still survive in the Royal Collection we can gain some measure of Sagredo’s connoisseurship.
Thus the Carracci drawings there come from three volumes which he bought towards the very end of his life from the famous Bonfiglioli collection in Bologna.4 This purchase, which included fine sheets by Raphael5 and ‘numbers of Original Pieces by the greatest masters’, attracted much attention among connoisseurs of the day.6 However, another of Sagredo’s possessions was of very much greater importance for the future of
Venetian eighteénth century taste and art: this was his magnificent set of drawings, the finest in existence, by the Genoese artist Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione.7 In the generation after Zaccaria’s death prints and drawings by this master were to be enormously admired in Venice and throughout Europe—with good reason, for his brilliant fluency and cult of the ‘picturesque’ anticipate much that was most vital in rococo draughtsmanship. The connoisseur Francesco Algarotti was keen tò purchase Sagredo’s volumes for the King of Saxony, but they were in fact obtained by Joseph Smith, who
, was also given a large number of additional Castiglione drawings by Algarotti himself.
Another connoisseur, Antonio Maria Zanetti the Elder, himself a friend of Sagredo, was also a lover of Castiglione and in 1759 engraved twelve ofhis drawings.8 Of greater

[Page 267]
significance was the admiration that Tiepolo felt for Castiglione. We know that he himself owned a monotype by the artist, and his passionate study of his great Genoese predecessor is apparent in the subject-matter and technique of his own etchings, as
Algarotti was the first to point out.1 -
This admiration for Castiglione’s prints and drawings only became fervent and widespread after Zaccaria Sagredo’s death, but he seems to have been the first in Venice to have experienced it, and to have collected these works by the master on an extensive scale. The drawings were chosen with great care and were said to have been bought by
Sagredo for 1500 zecchini.2 We have no certain knowledge of who sold them to him, but one source seems very likely. In 1706 Ferdinando Carlo Gonzaga, the last Duke of
Mantua, sought refuge in Venice from the invading Austrians.3 Two years later, ‘usé par la débauche, malade de la goutte’, he died in Padua at the age of 56. In the meantime, however, he had had sent to him over 900 pictures from the ducal collections, which before his death he had widely distributed among his courtiers. Eventually the Duke of
Lorraine successfully established his claim to be heir to the Gonzaga effects, but despite this a great number of pictures from Mantua turned up on the Venetian market.
Rosalba Carriera bought two for the Elector Palatine and the German collector Field
Marshall Schulenburg bought a large batch4 among which were several Castigliones, for this artist had been court painter at Mantua for over twenty years. Although there is no specific reference to drawings among the works of art sent to the Duke in Venice, either Ferdinando Carlo himself or someone in his immediate entourage may well have owned the large quantity from which Sagredo made up his volumes—especially as some of them specifically relate to pictures that Castiglione painted at Mantua.5 But whatever their origin, Zaccaria Sagredo’s main title to fame as an important pioneer in taste depends on his collection of these drawings. And, on a more personal level, the thought of the old man poring over the sad, secret poetry of Castiglione gives us an insight into his character which is missing from the all too scanty records that have survived.

1 So many foreign travellers comment on the isolation of the ambassadors that we can be sure that it was vigorously maintained throughout the century. But there is disagreement as to how far the nobles were accessible to ordinary visitors. At one extreme there is the evidence of Gibbon who, in a sit of bad temper, wrote in 1765 (Letters, I, p. 193) that ‘all communication with the natives of the place is strictly forbid’. At the other is that of Blainville who went out of his way to deny reports that the nobles were unapproachable (I, p. 492), and Cardinal de Bernis, the French Ambassador in 1752, said that the law had little effect even in preventing ‘amitiés vives et constantes’ between foreigners and Venetian nobles. But he admits that contacts could only be established through secret agents and that he only spoke once with the-Procurator Emo whom he looked upon as his closest ally in Venice—Mémoires, I, pp. 183 and 435.

6 In Vicenza, for instance, the Montanari were at first refused patrician status, but after building one of the most spectacular palaces in the city they were admitted to the nobility in 1687 for, among other things, the ‘costruzione di fabbrica che accresce il lustro di questa Patria’—Coggiola-Pittoni, 1935, p. 296.

An inventory of some of the Labia pictures in 1749 (Archivio di Stato, Venezia—Sezione Notarile: Pietro Zuccoli 14292) includes the following pictures by him in the palace—all 4s braccia high and 3 J braccia wide: (1) La Beata Vergne in Egitto, e S. Giuseppe.

2 After a long period of decay the villa has now been restored. The influence of St Peter’s was noted by eighteenth-century poets—see Daniele Florio: Le Crazie, Venezia 1766, p. xli: ‘Di Roma alia gran piazza area simile/Prima due mostra ali piegate in arco.’

3 ibid., p. 33. The pictures are now divided between Leningrad and Vienna. The subject of one of the Vienna canvases, which has been described by Morassi (1955, fig. 11) and others as Eteocles and Polynices is, in fact, Brutus killing Arruns—also taken from L. Annaeus Florus (Loeb edition, p. 33.) In the room where the Tiepolos once hung is a large ceiling fresco showing a dolphin amid various gods and goddesses of antiquity, representing Abundance, etc., and also attributes of the Ans and Sciences, Time, Fame and other symbolical figures. It is surrounded by a most elaborate architectural framework of the Bolognese type. Both the artist and date, of this fresco arc still very mysterious, but despite some suggestions to the contrary I am inclined to place it some years after Tiepolo’s canvases.

1 In 1759 Tiepolo and his son Gian Domenico were recalled to Udine by a new patriarch, Daniele Dolfin, nephew of Dionisio, to decorate the Cappella della Purità near the Cathedral.
2 See the sort of statement to the press, ignored, as far as I am aware, by modern writers, made before Tiepolo left for Spain and published in the Nuova Veneta Gazzetta of 20 March 1762: ... Ho udito dite dal Signor Tiepolo stesso, che molti giovani, anche fra suoi allievi, quando credono di saper qualche cosa, più non vogliono studiare, ed arenano quel progresso, per cui fare hanno bastante talento. Aggiunse che li Pittori devono procurare di riuscire nelle opere grandi, cioè in quelle che possono piacere alli Signori Nobili, e ricchi, perchè questi fanno la fortuna de’ Professori, e non già l’altra gente, la quale non può comprare Quadri di molto valore. Quindi è che la mente del Pittore deve sempre tendere al Sublime, all'Eroico, alla Perfezione.’

1 The almost complete absence of contracts for secular decorations in eighteenth-century Venice makes it difficult to decide how much choice of subject was left to the artist. There must have been a good deal ofconsultation between patron and painter. We can get some hints about current practice from artists’ biographies. Thus Zannandreis, writing (p. 426) about the Veronese painter Francesco Lorenzi, suggests that it was he who provided Tiepolo with an allegorical scheme for glorifying the King of Spain.

1 Because of his reriring private life, information about Zaccaria Sagredo is scarce. Barbaro in the Arbori de patritri veneti (Archivio di Stato, MSS. VI, c. 507) says merely that he was born on 15 October 1653, the son of Stessano Sagredo and Vienna Foscarini, and that Fu Pod.a a Bergamo fece una Galleria di sculture, pitture, e stampe’ and died in May 1729.
