FOREIGN INFLUENCES
- iTATE, nobles and Church had been the traditional sources of-patronage and we
Shave seen how they operated during the first part of the eighteenth century. All three tended to promote the ‘conservative’, Counter Reformation elements in Italian painting, and this led to a type of art that could only be fully appreciated in countries with somewhat similar regimes—notably Southern Germany and, later, Spain, where
Tiepolo was called in to satisfy illusions of grandeur that bore little relation to the realities of eighteenth-century European politics. Essentially, the paintings produced for all three types of patron reflected that Venetian desire to isolate herself from the contemporary world that was manifested in other fields through the censorship and the restrictions placed on foreign ambassadors and visitors. But there was another Venice— the famous, cosmopolitan city of pleasure with its throngs of tourists and dilettantes who came from societies totally different in spirit; and to cater for their tastes a wholly new kind of art came into being—one far more in touch with contemporary fashion elsewhere in Europe, whether it veered to the rococo or the neo-classical, than were the exalted visions of Tiepolo, Piazzetta and other history painters.
Europe was at war, but Venice remained neutral. Foreign embassies intrigued, foreign kings came to seek her alliance or to relax from the pressure of military campaigns. In 1703 the British Ambassador’s first secretary, Christian Cole, came across a
Venetian girl, Rosalba Carriera, painting snuff-boxes and miniatures on ivory. He persuaded her to turn to pastel portraits and within a few months her delicate, flimsy work was being compared to Guido Reni.1 In 1707 the Ambassador himself, Lord.
Manchester, returned to Venice on a second official visit and commissioned Luca
Carlevarijs to record his entry.2 A year later he quarrelled with the Republic, and left’ taking back with him to England Rosalba’s brother-in-law, Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini, and the young landscape painter Marco Ricci.3
Cole played a very important pan in Anglo-Venetian artistic relations. It was almost certainly he who advised the Duke of Manchester to choose Rosalba’s brother-in-law, Pellegrini, as the painter to take back to England in 1707, and in 1710 and 1711 he wrote to Lord Dartmouth enclosing estimates of pictures signed by Sebastiano Ricci and Niccolo Cassana—Osti, 1951, p. 119.

[Page 277]
And the German princes came in force: Maximilian of Bavaria found time amid the disasters that befell him in 1704 to commission from Rosalba his portrait and those of the most beautiful women in Venice. He was followed by Duke Christian Louis of
Mecklenburg and the Elector Palatinate with similar commissions and invitations to
Germany. In 1709 Frederick IV of Denmark took time off from his war with Sweden for a holiday in Venice, where he was lavishly entertained and so impressed by Venetian women that he too commissioned Rosalba to record their beauty in twelve pastels,1 while Luca Carlevarijs painted for him the regatta that had been offered in his honour.2
Above all there was the Prince Elector of Saxony, later to be Augustus III of Poland, who visited Venice three times during the first two decades of the eighteenth century and whose admiration for Rosalba’s art was limitless, as is testified by the huge collection of her work that he was to amass in Dresden.3
For these men and others like them Venice was not-an. impoverished Republic trying desperately to maintain her former status in the world; her inhabitants were not haughty nobles keen to assert their aristocratic claims in the face of upstarts who threatened to swamp them. Rather, she was a haven of peace, still fantastically rich, where their entertainment was encouraged by a government only too anxious to win as many friends as possible; a city whose palaces were filled, as nowhere else in Europe, with
’ easily appreciated masterpieces of sensuous beauty and whose courtesans were renowned for their charms. It is hardly surprising that they wished to have both city and women recorded for them to take back to their warring kingdoms in the North.
With peace in Europe came the French; above all a new type of collector, symbolised by Pierre Crozat, the fabulously rich banker whose house in Paris had already replaced Versailles as a centre for young artists. In Rosalba’s pastels which he saw during his visit of 1715 he found exactly what he was looking for; he wrote to her later and promised her a painting by Watteau in exchange for her work, as this artist whom he met on his return to France at the end of the year was the only man ‘able to produce something worthy of you’, and he was not satisfied until in 1721 he persuaded her to visit him in Paris.4 But for years before this visit, Rosalba had already been working mainly for foreigners.
English, French and German visitors could agree with enthusiasm about the merits of her work, and ambassadors from all these nations might employ Carlevarijs and later
Canaletto to record their entries into Venice,5 but for other and more important

[Page 278]
commissions there was a divergence of taste which was soon to become very pronounced.
It has been seen that many German courts had been obtaining works of art from
Italy for at least a generation, and they went on purchasing pictures in the late Baroque style to which they had grown accustomed.1 The more powerful of them were able to attract the artists themselves as well as their pictures. The Hapsburgs summoned
Sebastiano Bombelli to Vienna, and in 1709 employed Antonio Bellucci as their court painter. In 1716 the Dalmatian Federico Bencovich followed them there.2 Gaspare
Diziani went to Dresden in 1717 and worked for three years as scene painter for Augustus the Strong.3 By this time Giacomo Amigoni was already in Munich painting for the
Elector Max Emmanuel and working alongside French craftsmen in the rococo pavilions of the Nymphenburg gardens.4
The English too made it worthwhile for Venetian artists to leave their native country, but as patrons they were very different from the autocratic princes of South
Germany or Austria. Lord Manchester, who brought back Marco Ricci and Pellegrini from his embassy to Venice in 1709, was a cultivated diplomat with a wide experience of the world, a passionate lover of opera, a man in close touch with an influential group of dilettantes and poets.6 He belonged to that society of Whig noblemen who were consolidating their victory of 1688 over the King and making sure that the new dynasty should look to them for support. He and his friends, the Duke of Marlborough, Lord
Carlisle and others, were having their great country houses built for them by the gentleman-architect Vanbrugh and were laying the foundations of a revived feudal aristocracy that was to govern England for over a century. In some ways they resembled the Venetian oligarchy ruled by a Doge with little more than nominal powers, and it is not surprising that their sons should have looked back admiringly to sixteenth-century
Venice and its leading architect Palladio as the embodiments of their own ambitions and tastes. Unlike the Venetians of their own day, however, these men were optimistic and fully aware that their country was entering on an age of unparalleled prestige and riches. They could afford to borrow from the Continent and yet be confident that the future lay with them. ‘Music’, wrote the Duchess of Marlborough to Lord Manchester,6
‘is yet in its nonage, a froward child which gives hopes of what he may be hereafter in
England, when the masters of it shall find more encouragement. It is now learning
Italian, which is the best master, and studying a little of the French air to give it somewhat of gaiety and fashion.’ So too with painting.
When Pellegrini and Marco Ricci arrived in London they were at once set by Lord
Manchester to paint scenes for Scarlatti’s opera of Pyrrhus and Demetrius, and then to

[Page 279]
decorate his mansions in Arlington Street and at Kimbolton in Huntingdonshire, rebuilt for him by Vanbrugh.1 The same architect had for some years been erecting in Yorkshire a country house as palatial as any German imitation of Versailles for Lord Carlisle, a young man who had already embarked on a career to be more noted for its dazzling social prestige than for any real political achievement. He, too, extensively employed the two Venetian artists who from Castle Howard then moved to Narford Hall in
Norfolk, the country seat of the most interesting of all their English patrons, Sir Andrew
Fountaine, a rich collector and connoisseur who had travelled widely in Europe.2
In England Pellegrini, like some glistening butterfly, shed the last fragments of the tough membrane of seventeenth-century stolidity that had hitherto inhibited his already adventurous achievement. In a series of mythologies, histories, capricci and portraits, a new style was created—weightless, sensual, sometimes clumsy and melodramatic, but nearly always free of tensions. Rose-pink plumes shimmer against a blue sky streaked with feathery white clouds; light sparkles on fragile armour; golden tresses spill down flushed and invitingly naked flesh; fancifully dressed musicians in costumes of shot silk lean over a balustrade and playfully allude to Veronese with none of the hard commitment of Sebastiano Ricci or, later, of Tiepolo (at this date still only an apprentice). New and subtle colour combinations of mauves and greens, transparent reds and silvers add to the remarkable freshness of Pellegrini’s painting.
Some of the credit for these innovations must be given to the comparatively uninhibited atmosphere of England. The easy elegance and charm of Van Dyck’s portraits, so different from the pompous images of Venetian Senators, not only gave him a number of technical hints, but also taught him something essential about the nature of English society. He learnt his lesson quickly, as is shown by a lively and informal drawing he made of Pierre Motteux, the enterprising translator of Rabelais and Cervantes, a journalist and picture dealer who moved in the theatrical group which circulated round Lord Manchester (Plate 46).3 The engagingly ‘private’ and witty observation in a work of this kind anticipates the best conversation pieces that became so dear to English society—a vein also exploited by Marco Ricci in a number of half-caricatured musical groups that must certainly have fascinated Hogarth (Plate
In 1712 Pellegrini and Marco Ricci quarrelled. Both left England, but within a year Marco returned with his uncle Sebastiano and the two men were soon busily at work.'Sebastiano belonged to an older generation than Pellegrini. His early patrons had mostly been the powerful autocratic rulers of northern and central Italy, and from his extensive travels he had absorbed a wide variety of styles which he was liable to display with a sometimes excessive facility. Though he too could be a bold innovator, his manner was much more tied to the past than was Pellegrini’s and also much more taut, solid and robust. One of his earliest employers in England was Lord Portland, who

[Page 280]
had already commissioned paintings from Pellegrini.1 This young man was the son of
William Ill’s great favourite, the Dutch William Bentinck, whose loyalty to the Orange cause had been rewarded with vast estates.2 Henry, who succeeded to the Portland title in 1709 and was created first Duke in 1716, had lived a great deal abroad and had had his portrait painted by Rigaud in 1699—a work that seems to endorse the opinion of a contemporary that he was ‘a fine fellow, but very affected’. He commissioned paintings from Ricci for his town house, and above all for the chapel of his country house at
Bulstrode Park in Buckinghamshire—The Ascension, The Last Supper, The Baptism of
Christ and The Visitation.3 Strangely enough this was a programme that would not have been out of place in any Cathode church. When Vertue saw the paintings some twenty years later, he understandably praised them for the ‘noble free invention; great force of lights and shade with variety and freedom in the composition of the parts’.4
Within a few months of his arrival in England Ricci was working for Lord
Burlington, soon to become the most influential patron of the first half of the century.5
But it was not until May 1715 when the young peer had returned from his conventional
Grand Tour to Italy and set about rebuilding and redecorating his great mansion in
Piccadilly that he began to employ the Venetian artist on an extensive scale.8 As yet he had no special interest in the austere Palladianism which was later to preoccupy him, and he was as keen as any other nobleman of the age to decorate the interior of his palace with large and colourful Italian paintings. ‘The wall with animated pictures lives’, wrote Gay rather clumsily of Burlington House in 1715, and indeed a great number of mythological-and history paintings by Sebastiano Ricci were let into the walls and ceilings, some'of which were later transferred to Burlington’s villa at Chiswick.7
Ricci had many enthusiastic patrons among the Whig nobility and important officials—before leaving in 1716 he painted a fresco of The Resurrection in that most national of institutions, the Chelsea Hospital—and a few months after his departure another of his compatriots, Antonio Bellucci, arrived in England and was equally well received. Indeed, one of his first patrons was a man who had already given employment to Sebastiano Ricci. John Sheffield, Duke of Buckingham since 1703, in which year he had begun to have built his great London house, stood politically rather outside the circles which biave so far been considered.8 Though he acknowledged the new constitutional monarchy, he had been a staunch supporter of James II, one of whose illegitimate daughters he had chosen as his third wife. He was described by Prince Eugene in

[Page 281]
1712 as ‘a sanguine man, but of great parts andesteemed a true patriot’. He became a special favourite of Queen Arme, and when she died he retired from politics. He was by then aged 67 and despite his political affiliations had acquired a great and influential position in society. Within a year or two, as his mansion neared completion, he employed Bellucci to paint the walls of the staircase with scenes of Dido and Aeneas while the ceiling was, in his own words, ‘filled with figures of gods and goddesses’, and on the ceiling of another room Bellucci painted an allegorical tribute to himself and his
Duchess, which she paid for in the year of her husband’s death.
-Bellucci’s most important English patron was James Brydges, who managed to get himself created first Duke of Chandos in 1719 at the age of 46.1 Though born in poverty he acquired an immense fortune from war profiteering after having served for eight years as Paymaster to the Forces. In 1713 he acquired the old Elizabethan manor of
Canons at Edgware and he spent the next few years turning it into a vast palace in which he entertained his friends with magnificent concerts organised by Handel and Dr
Pepusch. He had a number of ceilings in the state rooms both at Canons and in his
London house painted with allegorical subjects by Bellucci and, above all, he employed this artist together with the Bolognese stuccatore Bagutti and a mysterious figure called
Francesco Sleter to decorate the chapel. Bellucci painted three large and twenty smaller canvases which were let into the rococo ceiling, representing The Nativity, The Descent from the Cross and The Ascension, around which were grouped putti holding the
Instruments of the Passion.2
-Thus for a decade before about 1720 Venetian history painters received wide support in England. The rich, the powerfully placed and the leaders of fashion were keen to employ them on their new and ostentatious mansions. Unhampered by any long traditions of hereditary patronage, these men seem to have inspired the artists who worked for them with fruitful vitality. Most historians are agreed that the English work of Pellegrini, Ricci and Bellucci constitutes their greatest achievements. But the situation was not to last.
‘ When Pellegrini left England in 1712 he went to Düsseldorf. When Bellucci arrived in London a few years later he came from Düsseldorf. So too did two other
Venetian artists who arrived in England—Vincenzo Damini, a minor painter, and
Giacomo Leoni, an architect who helped to inaugurate the Palladian movement. In fact, for a short time, Düsseldorf was with London and Paris one of the great centres of tfie-more adventurous Venetian artists. The town was the capital of the Palatinate, and was ruled over by the Elector Johann Wilhelm, who was the most interesting of all the
German art patrons during the first two decades of the eighteenth century.
Johann Wilhelm came to power in 1690, in a state which had been utterly devastated by the troops of Louis XIV. Almost at once he was forced to quell a serious revolt,

[Page 282]
but soon after, his fortunes turned. For some years between 1708 and 1714 he achieved unparalleled influence in German politics, and with the growing success of his intrigues and military prowess it seemed possible that the Palatinate might achieve the status of one of the great powers. His love of glory-was reflected in the adulation of the artists who surrounded him. ‘S’il auroit vécu aux terns des anciens Romains’, wrote one of his courtiers, Giorgio MariaRapparini,1 ‘leur superstitieuse veneration n’auroit pas manque de lui former son Apothéose’—but Rapparini himself, who could scarcely mention his master’s name without comparing him to Alexander the Great, hardly lagged behind the Romans in superstitious veneration, and much of the art created at
Dusseldorf during these years, such as the bronze equestrian statue by the Flemish sculptor Gabriel Gruppello, was inspired by the Elector’s passion for self-display. But he also had a genuine love of art for its own sake: ‘à l’égard de la Peinture, sa noble manie est si forte, qu’après avoir dépouillé la plus grande partie de la Flandre amatrice pour en composer la plus belle Galerie de l’Europe, j’ay oui après de sa Serenissime bouche saisié d’un enthusiasme d’amour pour cet Art; que pour une rare Pièce de quelque excellent Maître, il se depouilleroit à moitié’. This enthusiasm for collecting and patronage was no doubt spurred by Johann Wilhelm’s marriage to Anna Maria Ludovica, the last of the Medici, and it was guided by Rapparini, who was-a painter as well as a writer and who had studied under Carlo Maratta in Rome. In his writings Rapparini shows himself so anxious to give unqualified praise to everyone that his taste can only be described as eclectic. But despite the general enthusiasm all round, one theme constantly reasserts itself: ‘Une austère régularité de l’Art rebutte les Amateurs memes de l’Art.
Si le Peintre ne montre point au dehors quelque agrément de facilité, qui attire au plaisir d’imiter en cachant le dificile, on en décourage le Sectateur qui s’en va ailleurs.
La Science vraiment de plaire à l’oeil materiel, consiste surtout dans le cromatique, c’est à dire dans le coloris. Sans ce charme mignon la Peinture perd trop de sa force, et n’a plus cette magie d’enchanter. Il faut égayer parci, parla son Tableau par une manière riante, qui régné d’un bout à l’autre de la Pièce.’ It was in this spirit, so particularly congenial to Venetian artists, that Johann Wilhelm amassed vast quantities of works from
Italy2—especially by Luca Giordano—and commissioned painters such as Cignani,
Franceschini, Gian Gioseffo dal Sole and Francesco Trevisani to work for him in Bologna and Rome. He also tried, albeit without success, to persuade Antonio Balestra and
Rosalba Camera (who acquired pictures for him in Venice) to come to Dusseldorf.3
For references to Francesco Trevisani and Balestra who, ‘geloso della sua liberta’, refused regular

[Page 283]
He was just as enthusiastic—if not more so—about the Dutch. He visited Holland in
1696, and he avidly collected works by Jan Weenix, Adrian van der Werff and many others. Both Weenix and Van det Werff were invited by him to Düsseldorf, and though the latter refused to accept an official post as court painter, he agreed to work exclusively for the Elector for six months in every year, and large numbers of his smooth, light, enamelled paintings—in which ‘on ne voit rien de stante, rien d’oisif, rien de leche, rien de sec, et de dur’—found their way into Johann Wilhelm’s gallery. But the real importance of this gallery lay elsewhere. For it Johann Wilhelm had ‘presque vuide toute la Flandre et la Hollande’. Seventeen paintings by Van Dyck and forty by Rubens, whose ‘bizarrerie et bravure’ made a special impact and which are now among the most splendid treasures of the Alte Pinakothek in Munich, prove that for once Rapparini’s claims were not excessively exaggerated. Despite the debt that both artists owed to
Venetian painting, they were little known in that city and their effect on the receptive
Pellegrini was considerable.
Some sixteen years after the Elector’s death in 1716 the Baron de Pöllnitz passed through the Palatinate and described the achievements of this ‘Prince magnifique en toutes choses . . . Aencreux, liberal. Il protegeoit les Arts et les Sciences; sa Cour et sa depense etoient Royales; sa bonte le rendoit aimable; il etoit les delices de ses Courtisans,
Tamour de ses Sujets.’1 The gallery consisted of five great rooms, three of them much larger than the others. The first was entirely devoted to Rubens; the second contained works by Van Dyck and other Flemish and Dutch artists. The third contained Italian paintings, then there was one given over to Van der Werff and finally the fifth contained pictures by the greatest Flemish, Dutch and Italian old masters—Raphael and
Veronese, Titian and Carracci, Correggio and Guido Reni, Rubens and Rembrandt.
In all the rooms were displayed bronzes and cabinets of miniatures, and below them was another gallery containing casts of the main sculptures in Florence and Rome.
In this exhilarating atmosphere Pellegrini worked for three years.2 On a ceiling of a staircase in the Elector’s castle at Bensburg he painted a magnificent fresco of the Fall of Phaethon unparalleled among his works for verve, colour and strength of drawing.
But, above all, he was called upon to satisfy the Elector’s insatiable desire for glorification. He painted a series of canvases depicting in allegorical form the benefits of Johann
Wilhelm’s rule (Plate 49a). There is a certain awkwardness about the composition of some of these and a confusion of styles that may reflect the impact on Pellegrini of the
Elector’s widely varied picture gallery and especially of the Flemish artists in it. But they are painted with a freshness, buoyancy and lighthearted delicacy of colour that have no parallel in Venice itself at this date. Bellucci, too, celebrated his German patron with allegories and group portraits which are much more clumsy than Pellegrini’s, but employment under him—see the manuscript Eves of these two artists in the Bibhoteca Augusta, Perugia,
MSS. 1383.
For a long and fully documented account of the work of Foggini, Soldani and other Florentine sculptors for Johann Wilhelm—see Lankheit, 1956, pp. 185-210.

[Page 284]
which show that he was among the earliest of the eighteenth-century Venetian artists to appreciate the example of Veronese.1
Pellegrini’s connections with Düsseldorf made it logical enough that he should move to the Low Countries when the Elector died in 1716? He worked in Antwerp and Amsterdam, where he was actually commissioned to decorate the city hall with frescoes—the first time an Italian artist had ever painted in Holland and a remarkable sign of the cosmopolitanism of early eighteenth-century culture. From Holland he was taken back to England for a short rime in the summer of 1719 to decorate the country house of the English Ambassador in The Hague, Lord Cadogan, a man who -had served as commander with Marlborough in Flanders and had later been a Whig M.P.
Paris was the third town which helped to liberate Venetian painting from the bondage of the past. Sebastiano Ricci went there in 1716, on his departure from London.
He was at once brought into touch with Pierre Crozat, then aged 51, whose fine mansion in the Rue Richelieu contained a superb collection of paintings and, above all, many thousands of drawings by all the greatest Italian and Flemish masters.3 Crozat used to arrange weekly meetings of an exceptionally alert group of art-lovers, painters and writers, and he was generous in giving hospitality to artists and making his collection easily available to them. When Ricci arrived, Charles de la Fosse, who had himself been to London, was lodged in Crozat’s house. He was in his eightieth and last year, and though an enthusiastic admirer of Venetian painting, he was not impressed by Ricci.4
But, more importantly, Crozat’s latest discovery, the 32-year-old Antoine Watteau, was living in his house, and the elderly Venetian admired his work sufficiently to copy a sheet of his drawings.5 '
Four years after Ricci came his rival Pellegrini with his sister-in-law Rosalba
Carriera and their common friend Antonio Maria Zanetti, the engraver and connoisseur. This visit, marked the peak of Venetian influence abroad and the last time that contemporary Italian art was to make a serious impact on France. The aristocratic society, with which the three artists were at once brought into contact through the patronage of Crozat, was indulging in a relaxed atmosphere of careless rapture induced by the death of their great oppressor Louis XIV and the apparently miraculous benefits that could be obtained from financial speculation. Pellegrini was at once given the'task of decorating the very symbol of the new regime, the Mississippi Gallery in the Banque
Royale, which was the headquarters of John Law’s reckless, but as yet successful,
Système. The programme given to the artist represented a curious combination of royal glorification on the lines made familiar under Louis XIV at Versailles and allegorical tributes to commerce which were to become general only in the second half of the

[Page 285]
eighteenth century.1 He was to express ‘les différents avantages de la Banque, et de les rapporter à la gloire du Roi et de Mgr le Régent’. This extraordinary task was achieved by the use of a somewhat strained mythological iconography. The King was in the centre, supported by Religion and the Régent; these figures were surrounded by others representing ‘le Commerce suivi de la Richesse, de la Sûreté et du Crédit’, and all the gods of Olympus were called in to portray Munificence, Magnanimity and the countless other virtues which characterised the scheme. Elsewhere the Seine and the Mississippi were seen embracing, and views of ports and ships and the Bourse with men bargaining made the same points in more concrete terms.
Exactly how well he coped with the commission it is impossible to tell as the destruction of the frescoes followed soon after the collapse of the Système which they had celebrated. Years later, when the whole climate of taste had changed, Mariette, who strongly condemned, this destruction, saidThat the frescoes were of an ‘invention . . .
heureuse. Il y avait du fracas et des groupes agréables,’ but he criticised the drawing and colour.2 None the less it seems likely that the frescoes had a considerable influence on
French painting of the first half of the eighteenth century.
Pellegrini painted other works in Paris, including at least one altarpiece,3 but the real success of the trip was due to Rosalba. She was welcomed by Crozat, who lodged
' her in his house and organised a series of splendid receptions in her honour, and the delicate and subtle flattery of her informal portraits was greeted with wild enthusiasm by a society that was in full revolt against the artificiality and stiffness introduced by
Louis XIV and his court. Within two or three months of her arrival she had painted the portraits of John Law, the Régent, and the little King himself who kept flatteringly quiet during the sittings—as well, of course, as those of Crozat and his family. Round these central figures flocked the aristocrats and the ambassadors, all fighting for their portraits or little mythological pictures. The artists themselves were as keen. By October, four months after her arrival, she heard the news that ‘I have been unanimously admitted to the Académie. No vote was taken, as no-one wanted to make use of a black ball.’4
She met Rigaud and Watteau, both of whom expressed their deep admiration, and all the other artists and connoisseurs—Coypel, Vleughels, Oppenord, de Troy, Mariette.
When she left Paris in March 1721 she had conquered the city and made a. number of friends and admirers who were to remain loyal to her through every change of taste until her death in 1757. More importantly she gave a stimulus to a type of elegant yet intiniate portraiture that other artists were to bring to much greater heights than ever she had achieved and that remains one of the triumphs of French eighteenth-century painting. -
-iiThe cities of London, Diisseldorf and Paris were the most exciting centres of

[Page 286]
Venetian painting until early in the 1720s. Thereafter the situation began to change all over Europe. In England there had been ominous signs for many years that national feeling resented the success of these foreign artists. Alessandro Galilei, the Florentine architect who had arrived in 1714, said that ‘the English do not behave like people in
Italy, where if a foreigner arrives with a barest hint of talent, everyone rushes after him and native artists with far greater abilities are left behind. Here it is just the opposite because they want to employ only their own countrymen though they are complete donkeys... .' The remark was made by a disgruntled architect who had had no success
—but it contains an element of truth. -
The dome of St Paul’s, which had been a great magnet for the Venetian artists, was given to Thornhill to paint. So too was the ceiling of the Queen’s Bed Chamber at
Hampton Court, after the Earl of Halifax had said that the Treasury would refuse to pay if the commission was given, as had been intended, to Sebastiano Ricci. Moreover, the new style of architecture, promoted by Lord Burlington after his return from
Vicenza in 1719, gave little scope for great ceiling decorations ‘filled with figures of gods and goddesses’, and, as the Grand Tour became habitual and the English grew more sure of their tastes, they discovered that they did not like large-scale history painting—unless the artist was an Old Master who had died long ago. The career of
Amigoni, who arrived in England in 1730, some eight years after Bellucci’s departure, is symptomatic of the change. He was first greeted with great enthusiasm by Lord
Tankerville, a prominent Whig and at that time Lord of the Bedchamber to the Prince of Wales. Amigoni painted his staircase, but this was pulled down only eight years later.
He also painted a ceiling and the walls and staircase of Powis House in Great Ormond
Street with the Seasons and the story of Judith and Holofernes.2 It is impossible to be quite certain who was his patron here. Lord Powis himself was an elderly man of about 70.3 He had been one of James H’s most loyal followers, and as a consequence had been arrested on more than one occasion, the last time being during the Jacobite alarm of 1715. Two years earlier the great house which he had had built for himself had been occupied by the French Ambassador. During his tenancy it had been burnt to the ground and then rebuilt at the expense of the King-of France. In 1722 Lord Powis’s troubles came to an end. His estates, which had been forfeited on his outlawry many years before, were restored to him and he was summoned to take his seat in the House of
Lords, where he sat with the Tories. If he was the patron of Amigoni, it shows that the artist was moving in very different and far less fashionable circles than those that had welcomed his predecessors a generation earlier. Amigoni’s third and most important
English patron was a Mr Styles who had made a fortune out of the South Sea Bubble.
His country house at Moor Park was built for him in modified Baroque by Sir James
Thornhill and later Giacomo Leoni. Styles had intended to entrust Thornhill with the decoration, but the two men quarrelled and to spite the artist Styles gave the job to

[Page 287]
Amigoni and Francesco Sleter instead. We can be grateful for the dispute, for
Amigoni’s four canvases illustrating the story'of Jupiter and Io are the most beautiful that he painted in England (Plate 49b).1
Thus, Amigoni’s last big commission was due primarily to an accident. Thereafter he found it difficult to get any employment as a history painter, and he was compelled to turn more and more to portraiture. In this field his success was very great indeed and when he left England some ten years after his arrival he is supposed to have taken 4000 to 5000 with him, some of it derived from his work for the court. He also left a reputation which extended as far as Fielding’s Joseph Andrews.2 '
The English went on employing Venetian painters, but with rare exceptions they confined themselves to views, landscapes and portraits—usually by Bartolommeo
Nazari.3 Only one man proved wholly original in his patronage of Venetian and other artists’ and his very isolation shows how quickly English taste had hardened into a conventional pattern. Owen McSwiny (Plate 52a) was an Irishman whose early life was closely connected with the stage—as actor, dramatist and eventually impresario.4
In none of these careers was he a lasting success and it may have been this that encouraged him to make his first venture into the world of art with a plan to have engraved a series of Van Dyck portraits in English country house-s.5 This project too came to nothing, but it fascinated McSwiny, who returned to a similar plan in later years. Meanwhile his debts were pressing, and like many a man in such circumstances he left for the Continent in about 1711. For the next few years he disappears from sight but when he re-emerged it was with a scheme of great originality. Acting on behalf of Lord March, who became
Duke of Richmond in 1723, he proposed to have painted by the leading Italian artists a series of allegorical tombs to commemorate the great men of England’s recent history.
McSwiny had judged his moment well. For a full generation England had been on the crest of a great wave of optimism brought about by a series of military, political and intellectual triumphs which had carried her to the very forefront of Europe. Everyone recognised that her progress since the Glorious Revolution of 1688 had been immense, but now the protagonists were old or already dead and the time had come to celebrate their exploits. Meanwhile wealth at home and peace in Europe were encouraging

I suppose were the names of the painters’.

[Page 288]
thousands of English noblemen to visit the Continent and enjoy the pleasures of Italian art. There was thus every reason to believe that a project which combined reverence for England’s recent past with the prestige of modern Italian painting should do well. " ’ “ -
‘ McSwiny wrote1 that the monuments were to glorify ‘the British Monarchs, the valiant Commanders, and other illustrious Personages who flourish’d in England about the end of the seventeenth and the Beginning of the eighteenth Centuries’. It is almost certain that no definite list of these was drawn up from the start, for some of the characters who were eventually represented only died when the scheme was already under way. Most of those commemorated were, naturally, Whigs—but there was no strict political programme, for it was found possible to include Robert Harley, Earl of
Oxford, who had played such a great part in bringing to an end the wars waged by
Marlborough (also, of course, represented) and who had been imprisoned for two years in 1715. The pictures were all to be the same size, vertically inclined with semicircular tops like altar paintings. In fact, the scheme represented one of the first attempts to produce a secular and patriotic counterpart to the religious iconography of the Counter
Reformation and the more generalised ‘history painting’ of the Continent—among the figures commemorated were many of the ‘Saints’ of the Enlightenment such as Locke and Newton. Each picture was to contain an urn ‘wherein is supposed to be deposited the Remains of the deceased Hero. The Ornaments are furnish’d partly from the
Supporters and Arms of the respective Families; and the Ceremonies supposed to be perform’d at the several Sepulchres, as well as the Statues and Basso-Rilievo’s, allude to the Virtues, to the Imployments, or to the Learning and Sciences of the Departed.’
McSwiny wrote that these subjects which were ‘of his own Invention’ were
‘elegantly executed by the Pencils of the most celebrated Painters in Italy’. With one or two exceptions2 he chose these from Bologna and Venice, and he insisted that every picture was to be painted by three artists—one for die figures, one for the landscape and one for the buildings and other ornaments. Not surprisingly the painters concerned, who were not told the purpose of the scheme, were thoroughly puzzled by this ‘amateur with as-sound a knowledge of good pictures, books and antiquities as it is possible to have’ who suddenly arrived to commission ‘a number of strange and fanciful ideas which were neither histories nor fables’.3 In fact, McSwiny’s instructions to them must have rivalled Shaftesbury’s in minuteness of detail.
In Bologna he relied mostly on Donato Cred and Francesco Monti as his figure painters and in Venice on Piazzetta and Pittoni, while Canaletto and Cimaroli painted some of the landscapes (Plate 52b). All four Venetian artists were beginning their

[Page 289]
careers and Canaletto was as yet almost unknown. But Sebastiano and Marco Ricci who collaborated on the monument to the Duke of Devonshire were already wellestablished painters and must have required a substantial fee to produce such menial work for a commoner.1 The scheme began well, and by 1722 fifteen pictures had already been started, most of which were later acquired by the Duke of Richmond.2
Yet it ran into difficulties which were almost inseparable from McSwiny’s conception of the paintings. For attractive as many of the pieces are they entirely fail to achieve their declared aim which was ‘to perpetuate (as long as the Nature of such Things can permit) the Remembrance of a Set of British Worthies, who were bright and shining
Ornaments to their Country’. Rather, these ‘monumental pieces’ anticipate a taste, which only became general later in the century, for capricci in which a vague feeling of romantic melancholy is induced by the contrast between crumbling ruins of the past and elegant, fancifully dressed spectators—a gentle, ‘picturesque’ adaptation of the old
Pittoni
Paltronieri was a Bolognese painter. I am grateful to Sir Anthony Blunt for pointing out to me that at
Sir Robert Bernard’s sale at Christie’s, 9 May 1789, lot 68 was described as Petoni—A pair of Triumphal
Mausoleums.
This list does not wholly coincide with the one given by Vertue, V, p. 149, who recorded ten after his visit to Goodwood a few years later—William HI, George I, Devonshire, Wharton, Addison, Dorset,
Tillotson, Stanhope, Cadogan, Godolphin. The explanation is probably that the Duke of Richmond owned some fourteen or fifteen but did not keep them all at Goodwood.

[Page 290]
theme of Memento Mori. It was almost as difficult for McSwiny’s contemporaries as it is for us to understand the complex allusions to the virtues of his heroes. ‘I am persuaded you will forgive me’, wrote one client in 1729,1 ‘if I tell you that it has been thought your other pictures tho’ finely painted are defective in that respect [establishing the identity of the hero]—and I have already seen two of them which turned to a quite different design from what they were intended. I mean those for the late D. of Devonshire and Sir Cloudesly Shovel, the first of which is turned into a Brutus and the other into a Roman Admiral by my Lord Bingley in whose possession they now are.’2 As large decorative paintings hanging in the Duke of Richmond’s dining-room at Goodwood, where conscientious visitors could find ‘a written description left to explain the meaning’, they were admirable.3 As a homage to the great men of England which might set a fashion among those who cared for the heritage of 1688 they were wholly unsuitable. McSwiny himself realised their drawbacks, but he quite rightly understood that the slavish following of too logical an iconographical programme would destroy the charm that they had. ‘ ’Tis impossible to tell (in such a Narrow compass)’, he replied to his critic, ‘more than one Man’s story, without running into w.t wou’d be very
Trivial, & y.e pieces wou’d resemble the cutts in The Gierusaleme Liberata. In the
Monum.t to y.e Memory of the Duke of Malbro’ I make a Soldier, attended with
Guards &c as visiting y.e Monument of a great General. I mean nothing more in it but the visit—now if I was to represent his battles, Sieges and abilities as an able Counsellour
I have no way to do it but by Medaglions, Medals Basso-rilievo’s, Statues etc.’4
Despite these problems, the Duke of Richmond bought at least ten of the paintings, and other versions of some of them also found purchasers. Then in 1730 McSwiny scored ‘a fortunate hitt’ when Sir William Morice bought the remaining ones that had been completed.5 And he had in any case decided from the first that further profits could be obtained by issuing engravings of the series, and.for this purpose he employed the Bolognese artist D. M. Fratta to make drawings of the pictures as they appeared in
Bologna and Venice.6 Some time in the 1730s he issued a pamphlet addressed ‘To the
Ladies and Gentlemen of Taste’ in which he invited subscriptions for a magnificent volume—‘a more compleat Work of the Kind, than has ever yet been published in any part of Europe’. It was to include ‘fifty copper Plates, viz. twenty four Sepulchral
Pieces, twenty four Inscription Plates (ornamented with Emblematical Figures), the
Frontispiece and the Title-Plate; all of the same size with the Sepulchral Pieces; viz two
Foot two Inches in Height, and one Foot five Inches in Breadth.

[Page 291]
‘To which will be added (if the Encouragers of this Undertaking shall hereafter think fit) not only the Characters of the above-mentioned deceased Worthies but likewise those of many of their Contemporaries, who made considerable Figures in the
Court, the Camp, the Church and State, as well as in the several Branches of useful and polite Learning, and who contributed largely to the carrying of the Reputation and
Credit of the British Nation to a much higher Degree than it was ever before; with a succinct Account of the most memorable Transactions in the Reigns of King William and Queen Mary, Queen Anne, and King George.
‘The Whole to be adorn’d with Vignettes, Busto’s, Medaillons, Cuis des Lampes, and other proper and elegant Embellishments designed and engraved by the most celebrated Masters in Europe.’
The volume—Tombeaux des Princes grands capitaines et autres hommes illustres, qui ont fleuri dans la Grande-Bretagne vers la fin du XVII et le commencement du XVIII siecle— appeared in 1741, and was certainly very magnificent, but it must have disappointed
McSwiny who had returned to England some ten years earlier. There were eighteen instead of fifty plates, and only nine of the allegorical tombs were engraved—all from the Duke of Richmond’s collection. Only two of the heroes—Lord Dorset and Sir
Isaac Newton—were given Characters, while there was no account of the memorable transactions of the reigns of William III, Anne and George I. It is none the less a fine tribute to McSwiny’s enterprise and taste. Each painting is preceded by an inscription plate with the name of the hero surrounded by a rich decorative frieze designed by
Boucher and engraved by C. N. Cochin, Laurence Cars and others. In many ways these plates are more satisfying than those-of the actual tombs which were also engraved by
French artists. They contain allegorical allusions to the hero’s achievements and burst on to the page with a tense, virile vitality that is rarely found in Boucher’s work.1
The criticisms of the paintings and McSwiny’s failure to attract enough subscribers to complete the book shows once again how reluctant Englishmen now were to welcome contemporary Italian history painting—even when heavily disguised. But
McSwiny also catered for more conventional tastes. With his close friend, the English business man Joseph Smith, he dealt in pastels by Rosalba Garriera2 and views by Canaletto. Indeed he was among this artist’s first foreign patrons, though he had strong doubts about his merits. I hope you’l like ’em when they are done,’ he wrote to a client in 1727 of some pictures by Canaletto,3 ‘I am, it may be, a little too delicate in my choice, for of
Twenty pieces I see of him, I don’t like eighteen & I have seen several, sent to London y.t I wou’d not give house room too, nor Two pistols each. He’s a covetous, greedy fellow & because he’s in reputation people are glad to get anything at his own price.’
Though McSwiny’s enthusiasm was only qualified, he commissioned a number of

[Page 292]
pictures by Canaletto for English clients, and in doing so he was for once fully in touch with national taste. On the Grand Tour noblemen regularly brought back their sets of views by the master or his pupils. Canaletto took full advantage of such a steady clientèle and raised his prices so much that he became virtually inaccessible to others and rightly acquired the reputation of being spoilt by the English.1 Several generations of Englishmen saw Venice entirely through his eyes, sometimes with surprising results. When Dr
Burney, the great musicologist, arrived there in 1770 he confessed that ‘we form such romantic ideas of this city from its singular situation about which we hear and read so much that it did not at all answer my expectation as I approached it, particularly after seeing Canaletti’s view all of one colour: for I find it like other famous cities composed of houses of different magnitude, orders of architecture, ages, and materials.2 Many years later William Beckford, who rhapsodised about the mystery and decay of the city, none the less found that it had been perfectly depicted by ‘the pencil of Canaletti’.3
When in 1740 war in Europe greatly reduced the number of English travellers to the Continent, Canaletto found it necessary to come to this country, encouraged by
Amigoni, who had had plenty of opportunity for gauging English taste. He moved throughout the land painting a series of London views and country houses for dukes and enthusiastic amateurs who welcomed him despite the denigration of jealous rivals and boisterous patriots (Plate 51).4 With short breaks he remained here for nearly ten years, during which time his manner became increasingly mechanical, but his shorthand of little blobs to represent the human figure was later adapted to brilliant comic purpose by the satirist Thomas Rowlandson.
The career of the landscape painter Francesco Zuccarelli was even more successful.6
He arrived in England in 1752 and remained here for over fifteen years with one break of three. His clients included George HI and he became a founder member of the Royal
Academy.
The triumphs of Canaletto and Zuccarelli are symbolic of the complete break that had occurred in artistic taste between England and the Continent. But in Europe too the situation had changed notably after the second decade of the eighteenth century. In 1724
Pellegrini’s ceiling for the Banque Royale was destroyed, and thereafter, with the exception of Rosalba, contemporary Italian art proved of little interest to French collectors. As had happened some sixty years earlier, the French had taken just enough from the Italians to provide an impulse for their own native artists. But one man, who though not himself French was so impregnated with French culture that he must be considered here, continued to show great enthusiasm for Venetian art. Count Tessin was a Swede, son of the architect who had built the Royal Palace in Stockholm.6 He was born in 1695 and during bis early travels between 1714 and 1719 he first came into contact with Watteau. A few years later he achieved great political importance in his

[Page 293]
native country and in 1728 he became Surintendant des Bâtiments Royaux. During his honeymoon in Paris in the same year he was engaged in buying pictures and furniture for the King of Sweden and this brought him into touch with a number of French artists. In 1739 he became ambassador to France and during his three years in Paris he assembled a superb collection of contemporary drawings and paintings by all the leading artists, especially Boucher, whose wife’s lover he apparently became and from whom he had already commissioned a picture in 1737. The year before this he had been to Venice in search of a painter to decorate the Royal Palace in Stockholm. He was pleased with what he saw there—‘il est constant que l’école de Venise est sur turtrès bon pied, et quelle se distingue en Italie’—but he found little that satisfied his immediate requirements. In a well-known letter he enumerated the merits and drawbacks of the leading artists and found that only Tiepolo was ideal.1 ‘Tout est dans ses Tableaux richement vêtu jusqu’aux gueux etc. Mais n’est-ce pas la grande mode? Au reste, il est plein d’esprit, accomodant comme un Taraval, un feu infini, un colorit éclatant, et d’une vitesse surprenante... . .' InfortunLtel Ite was also able to command far higher prices than the Swedes could offer and the invitation to Stockholm met with no response. But
Tessin was able to indulge his own taste for the colourful and the pretty. He bought a
Danaë and a modello of the Beheading of St John the Baptist by Tiepolo for his personal collection, as well as views by Canaletto, Cimaroli and Richter, portraits and fanciful heads by Nazari and Nogari, drawings by Piazzetta and other works that attracted him.
Having failed to get royal patronage for Tiepolo, he wrote that he would do his best for
-the sculptor Gai, whom he particularly admired, though he seared that ‘jusqu’à cette heure je n’y vois encore que peu d’apparence, puis qu’il y a ici plusieurs sculpteurs
François engagés aux services de la cour qui ont enterpris tout ce qu’il y a de plus pressé à faire’.2 Tessin had made many friends in Venice and he remained faithful to them long after his art collecting was almost entirely confined to the French.
— iii —
Although French competition became increasingly serious as the century advanced
—‘hors de Paris point de salut’, was the opinion in Berlin3—Venetian artists went on
-finding enthusiastic patrons all over Germany. After the death of the Elector Johann
Wilhelm in 1716, Diisseldorf lost its importance, but the Hapsburgs and Schönborns who had hitherto stuck to the more traditional late-Baroque artists were now ready to welcome Pellegrini, Ricci and Rosalba Camera—partly indeed, because of their very success in the more ‘progressive’ towns of London, Paris and Düsseldorf.4 And in-1725.1 Siren, pp. 103 ff.

[Page 294]
Pellegrini went to Dresden where there was another sovereign whose fame as a patron was attracting international attention. Frederick Augustus I, Elector of Saxony, and since 1697 King of Poland as Augustus II ‘the Strong’, had made his court the most brilliant in Europe, and his munificent architectural policy was transforming Dresden into a city of dazzling beauty. But his interest in contemporary Venetian art was somewhat limited. He employed Gaspare Diziani for three years almost exclusively on painting scenery for the theatre and the festivals which were his special delight. Pellegrini was considered as a possible decorator for one of the rooms in the Zwinger, the fantastic rococo pavilion which had recently been completed by Pöppelmann, but his project was later destroyed and his activities in the city were otherwise confined to two paintings in the Catholic church for which Sebastiano Ricci had three years earlier painted an
Ascension.1 A year after Pellegrini came Antonio Zucchi, the engraver, who was employed in the famous print cabinet,2 and though Augustus considerably enlarged the gallery of pictures he had inherited, his purchases did not very much affect Venetian painters. Two large pictures by Pittoni, an artist particularly favoured by the Germans, were acquired by him before 1722—Nero being shown the Corpse of Seneca and Agrippina being killed on the orders of her son Nero. This gruesome subject evidently had a special appeal for him, for he owned a second version of it by another Venetian artist, Pietro
Negri, a pupil of Zanchi. When, however, a third, painted by the Roman Marco
Benefial, arrived in Dresden, his son clearly felt that its possibilities had been exhausted and he gave the picture away.3
Augustus the Strong also acquired six mythological and Biblical paintings by
Francesco Migliori, an attractive but not very significant Venetian artist of the first half of the eighteenth century, and others by Molinari and Bellucci. Virtually all these conform closely enough to that ideal of ‘nudité’ which so appealed to German taste. The patronage of his son Augustus III, who succeeded to the throne in 1733, was of a wholly different order. Until the disaster of the Seven Years War nearly a quarter of a century later the collecting activities of this man and his dictatorial minister Count Brühl were among the most outstanding in Europe, and under the direction of a Venetian artist,
Pietro Guarienti, the Dresden Gallery achieved its great pre-eminence over nearly all the others in Germany. His fabulous purchases for it—such as the hundred finest pictures from the collections of the Dukes of Modena—cannot be discussed here but must at least be mentioned as an indication of his vast artistic ambitions. Agents acquired works of art for him throughout Europe, and in Venice itself the brothers Ventura and Lorenzo
Rossi, who acted in this capacity, were always on the look out for suitable pictures.
Apart from a large number of old masters they acquired six landscapes for him by
Marco Ricci in 1738. But the real impact of contemporary Venetian painting only made itself felt when Francesco Algarotti returned to his native city in 1743 especially to

[Page 295]
purchase pictures for the King whom he was then serving. Algarotti’s commissions to
Tiepolo, Piazzetta, Amigoni, Pittoni and Zuccarelli are discussed in a later chapter1; but he also bought many pictures by these and other contemporary artists from private collections—two superb Piazzettas, one of them the famous Standard Bearer, two fine mythologies by Sebastiano Ricci and portraits and fantasy heads by Nogari and Nazari, artists who specialised in this type of picture which was ultimately derived from
Flanders.
No doubt all these appealed to Augustus, despite his initial reluctance to pay too much attention to the works of contemporaries, but he had one special favourite whose works he collected avidly on his own account—Rosalba Carriera. They had met during his own visits to Venice early in the century when, as crown prince, he had revelled in the company of the beautiful and vapid ladies whose features she recorded. But he was far from satisfied with the number of pastels he had acquired from her on those occasions.
Throughout his reign he was always keen to get more—from the artist herself or from private collections. His choice was catholic—portraits of friends and acquaintances or of pretty women he had never known, allegories such as the Four Seasons, or the Four
Continents, or the Four Elements, religious subjects such as the Magdalene or the Virgin
Mary. It hardly mattered as they were all equally attractive. His appetite was inexhaustible, and by the end of his life he had acquired over 150 examples of her work, while
Rosalba’s best pupil Felicita Sartori, who had married one of his councillors, came to
Dresden in 1741 and worked extensively for him.2
Another Venetian artist produced a great proportion ofhis output for Augustus III.
In 1747 Bernardo Bellotto, the nephew of Canaletto, arrived in Dresden and within a year he was appointed ‘pittore di corte’—a post which he held until the break-up of that court after the disasters of the Seven Years War.3 During that time he painted large numbers of views showing, with an observation of everyday reality that had not been seen since the bamboccianti, the busy brilliant capital at the height of its glory. They were often produced in series of three sizes—the largest for the King, a smaller version for Count Briihl and a third example for other clients. In 1765, after he had already found employment elsewhere, Bellotto returned to Dresden. Augustus, his great patron, had been dead two years and the artist stayed just long enough to paint the ruins of the Church of the Cross which had been wrecked in a bombardment of Frederick the Great that had shocked Europe.4 Then he left.
No sovereign in Germany could rival Augustus in his patronage or collecting, but there were others who showed within the range of their far more limited means an equal enthusiasm for contemporary Venetian painting. Thus Clemens August, Archbishop-Elector of Cologne and younger brother of the Elector of Bavaria, who had employed Amigoni, was also a frequent visitor to Venice.6 He too was naturally an

[Page 296]
admirer of Rosalba and owned pastels by her. Soon after 1730 he began commissioning altar paintings for the many churches under his patronage by Pittoni, Piazzetta—whose
Assumption of the Virgin painted in 1735 contained the first signs of his lighter manner— and by Tiepolo. But German patronage of Venetian art, and Venetian art itself, reached a climax in 1750 when Tiepolo was commissioned to decorate the Residenz in Würzburg.1 The bishopric had belonged to the Schonborn family, whose vast patronage has already been referred to, but after the death of Frederick Karl in 1746 and a short interval under his successor it was taken over by Karl Philip von Greiffenklau. It was he who with great difficulty and at enormous expense finally persuaded Tiepolo to come to
Wurzburg and decorate the Kaisersaal in the magnificent palace that had been built by Balthasar Neumann for his predecessors. The beautiful rococo room with its rich ornamentation of scagliola was quite unlike anything that Tiepolo had ever seen; the subjects to be painted, drawn from German mediaeval history, were equally foreign.
But this unfamiliarity merely stimulated him to higher peaks of brilliance. On the ceiling he painted Apollo conducting Frederick Barbarossa’s bride Beatrice of Burgundy in a chariot drawn by four prancing white horses to the awaiting Emperor—a scheme which he later adapted with suitable modifications to the Rezzonico family in Venice. On the walls he was required to paint the Marriage of the couple being blessed by the Bishop of
Würzburg in 1156 and Bishop Harold von Hocheim being invested with the princedom by the
Emperor in 1163. The German princely clergy could not boast the Roman ancestry of
Tiepolo’s Venetian clients, and in any case mediaeval life was the only suitable precedent for their feudal existence in the Age of Enlightenment. None of this worried-Tiepolo, who ‘placed the scene firmly in sixteenth-century Venice, where in fact for him all history took place’.2
As soon as the decoration of the Kaisersaal had been completed Tiepolo agreed to paint the ceiling of the great staircase of the palace—by far the largest expanse he had ever undertaken—with a fresco depicting The Four Continents paying homage to Karl
Philip von Greiffenklau (Plate 50). It would be charitable to describe this theme as anachronistic in 1752, but Tiepolo delighted in the dreams of absolutism. Unlike
Pellegrini and the Riccis who had given of their best a couple of generations earlier in an atmosphere of change and relatively free enquiry, Tiepolo was most at home in the last bastions of an autocratic and backward looking society. In this fresco, so much fuller of possibilities than anything that he had yet been required to do in Venice, he painted his supreme and most imaginative vision of the ancien régime.
Other courts besides those of Germany looked to Venice for talent. The rise of
Turin has been referred to in an earlier chapter.3 By the second decade of the century she had become powerful enough to attract artists from all over the peninsula. During most of the 1720s and early 1730s the architect Filippo Juvarra was artistic director of the city and on his authority a vast number of commissions was given to Sebastiano

[Page 297]
Ricci for paintings in the Royal Palace and for various churches.1 But the effects of this patronage were no longer as stimulating to Ricci, now an old man, as his travels of earlier days had been. He himself was prevented by a youthful misdemeanour from visiting Turin, and the grandiose scenes in the style of Veronese which he sent to the city have a somewhat hardened, academic quality which betrays a lack of inspiration.
Moreover, Juvarra himself showed only a very qualified attachment to Venetian painting. When, towards the end of 1735, he devised a scheme for decorating the Royal
Palace in Madrid, he was asked by the King of Spain to commission pictures from all the different schools in Italy.2 The fist he drew up included only one work by a Venetian
—Pittoni—as compared to four Romans and one each by a Genoese, a Neapolitan and a Bolognese. The proportion is extraordinary to present-day taste, but in some circles
Roman painters were still looked upon as the most ‘serious’ artists working in the
Grand Manner; though it is also possible that the old Spanish hostility for Venice may have played some part in determining the choice. If this is so, it no longer applied by
1739 when Amigoni went to Madrid as court painter.3 There he was followed by the far more uncompromisingly Venetian Tiepolo, who, after ruthless pressure ‘da chi puo comandare’, was sent out to Madrid in 1762 as part of an astute diplomatic move by the Venetian government.4 However much the nobility might still want to be immortalised by the great artist at the height of his powers, the old tradition of political cunning prevailed. On this his last mission Tiepolo, helped by his sons, once more drew upon all his resources to glorify a formerly powerful, but now declining, monarchy. And then, at the very end of his fife, inspired perhaps by the traditional fervour of Spain, he produced his most personal and most deeply felt religious painting in a series of altarpieces for the royal chapel at Aranjuez. Soon afterwards they were removed and replaced with works by the new international star Anton Rafael Mengs.
Tiepolo died in 1770, but while he was still active in Spain new conquests were being prepared by Venetian artists in the most distant outposts of Europe. Pietro Rotari had gone to St Petersburg from his native Verona as early as 1756, and until his death there six years later he painted several hundred pictures of all kinds ranging from portraits to mythologies. He was followed in 1762 by Francesco Fontebasso, a pupil of
Sebastiano Ricci, who decorated the Winter Palace,5 and in the same year Giacomo
Guaraña, another pupil of Ricci and Tiepolo, painted a Sacrifice of Iphigenia for Moscow.6
In 1723 Juvarra commissioned a painting from Marco Ricci to indicate his proposals for the Castello di Rivoli. As was to occur later in his commissions for Spain he showed his preference for Roman painting by ordering four pictures from there (two each from Pannini and Locatelli) compared with only one each from a Venetian and a Turinese artist—see Viale, 1950-1, p. 161.

[Page 298]
The dramatic accession to the throne in June 1762 of the insatiable Catherine the
Great provided a new but, as it turned out, not very fruitful impulse for the importation of Venetian pictures. Though her culture was mainly inclined towards France, Catherine showed in her artistic as in her other tastes a reluctance to confine herself to any one style and she did what she could to continue the policy of her predecessor. Thus
Bernardo Bellotto was planning to go to S t Petersburg after the collapse of the Dresden court and the death of Augustus III. But while already on the journey he was persuaded to stop in Warsaw by the new King of Poland Stanislas Poniatowski and, for twelve years until his death in 1780, he produced for that art-loving and reforming monarch a large number of views to record the rapidly changing aspects of his capital.1 Meanwhile in 1772 Pietro Antonio Novelli painted for the Empress a picture of Creusa imploring
Aeneas to rescue his father Anchises from the fire of Troy. Though he had gone out of his way to choose a ‘learned’ subject to compete with the painting by Pompeo Batoni opposite which it was to hang, the thought of the climate made him refuse the opportunity to outdistance his Roman rival by accepting an invitation to Russia.2 In any case Catherine’s admiration for Venetian art is testified not so much by the rather minor artists and their works that she was able to attract to her distant court as by her purchase of Tiepolo’s Banquet of Cleopatra. This masterpiece had been among those acquired for Augustus III by Francesco Algarotti many years earlier3 and its transference to
St Petersburg in the 1760s provides a striking reflection of the changing balance of power in Europe which had always played such an influential rôle in the diffusion of
Venetian art. But though it is true that Venice itself had perforce to remain a passive onlooker while many of the city’s best artists and their pictures were drawn to London,
Paris and Diisseldorf, Madrid, Dresden and Würzburg, it will become apparent in the next chapter that a more subtle relationship was possible between the dominant foreigner and native genius than one which was essentially built up on foundations of military strength and commercial wealth. For the Republic still retained many attractions and if kings and landowners-could do little more than glimpse these on brief holidays, others were free to settle within her frontiers and gain a much deeper awareness of the city’s treasures.

THE FOREIGN RESIDENTS
-1 -
CONSUL JOSEPH SMITH
HE most important link in Venice itself between the city and the outside world
Twas an Englishman, Joseph Smith, who became the greatest art patron of his day.
He was born in about 1675, educated at Westminster School and settled in Venice during the early years of the eighteenth century as a businessman and merchant.1 He traded extensively with Amsterdam and was concerned with the import of meat and fish—an activity which sometimes involved him in disputes with the guild of the
Salumieri.2 He quickly became rich and influential and his house was occasionally used for meetings between the Venetian nobility and English diplomats, which would have been awkward if held more openly.3 Early in the 1730s he began to take an interest in publishing which he put into practice by launching the firm of a young man, G. B.
Pasquali. Smith’s concern with this was far greater than merely financial, though money in any field was always a source of the keenest interest to him. For the first few years of the new venture he was actively engaged in the intellectual work involved. In 1735, for instance, he tried to enlist the help of the Florentine scholar A. F. Gori in a reprint of
Guicciardini’s Histories, and he promised in return to find English subscribers for that antiquarian’s own Museum Etruscum. The difficulties were great: unpublished material had to be secured from the family; a frontispiece, drawn by the ‘famous painter’ Gian
Domenico Ferretti of Florence, had to be engraved; and a suitable figure had to be found to whom to dedicate the book. Smith exerted himself in all these and many other aspects of the production, and also continued to buy books, gems and pictures for himself and for his clients.4 In 1744 he was made British Consul, a post inferior in status
These extend from 1727 to 1744, but the majority were written between 173 5 and 173 7. The Guicciardini was eventually published by Pasquali in 1738.

[Page 300]
to the Residency for which he had hoped. In 1762, a year after resigning the consulship, he sold the bulk of his library and most of his pictures to King George III. Then five years later, at the age now of nearly 90, he temporarily resumed the post of consul when his successor went bankrupt.1 He finally died in 1770 and was buried in the Protestant cemetery at S. Niccolo al Lido. His taste in pictures reflects much that we should expect from the two backgrounds, English and Venetian, hinted at in tins outline of his long, acquisitive and persistent Use.
As a patron of the arts and the owner of a superb library he was well known and appreciated in Venice, and he was in close contact with nearly all the leading painters.
He was also an assiduous theatre-goer and fond of the opera.2 And his palace on the
Grand Canal near the church of the Apostoli was the meeting-place for a number of the more adventurously inclined nobles and intellectuals, for besides his great interest in scholarly works and sine editions, Smith was always keen to publish books which in hidebound Venice were bound to appear controversial, if not actually subversive.3
Chief among these visitors was the sarcastic, anti-conformist Padre Lodoli who would come with his lively patrician pupil Andrea Memmo.4 Both of them were to play important roles in the art world of Venice, and Memmo later acknowledged the influence that the meetings at Consul Smith’s house had had on his taste. But their great friendship did not long survive their rivalry in love: both men were courting the beautiful Giustiniana Wynne, the illegitimate daughter of an English gentleman and a
Greek adventuress.5 Memmo was some sifty-four years younger than the English
Consul and his victory was inevitable. Thereafter Giustiniana was to turn up again and again as a link between many of the more intelligent patrons and writers of eighteenthcentury Venice.
Smith’s activities and influence may have diminished after 1744, in view of the government’s discouragement of contacts between the nobility and foreign representatives, though we do hear from the Resident himself that the Consul was far better placed from this point of view than his more senior colleague6; and Smith in his claim to the appointment specifically boasted that he had ‘contracted Friendships with some
Principal men in the Government... .’.7 In his earlier days at least he had had friendly relations at various times with the connoisseurs Apostolo Zeno, Francesco Algarotti and
Antonio Maria Zanetti, and Goldoni in the dedication to Smith of one of his plays,

II Filosofo Inglese, says that the Englishman had been among his keen admirers. From his will, drawn up in 1761, we get the impression that by this stage in his long Efe Smith had few close contacts in Venice beyond those of business. By far the most important of these were with his client Pasquali, who published catalogues of his gems and some of his paintings and books as well as many other works of.Eterature and philosophy which the Consul clearly suggested to him.1 And it is also very likely that he had certain definite business arrangements with some of the artists whom he employed for himself and others.2
Two of his most interesting Italian friends Eved in Padua. Of these, one was the
Abate Facciolati, a professor of history in the University, to whom he left three books
‘as a testimonial of my Esteem and respect and of my grateful sense of the friendship that for so many years [he has] honoured me with’. Facciolati had a remarkable collection of pictures which was designed to illustrate the history and progress of art beginning with a series of Byzantine paintings. Such private museums were still most unusual during the first half of the eighteenth century, though another one of Smith’s friends,
Padre LodoE, collected works of art on a similar principle.3 Smith’s other acquaintance in Padua was the Marchese Giovanni Poleni, also a professor at the University, and an engineer and architect of some distinction—in many ways a typical product of the provincial Enlightenment.4 These relationships suggest that Smith was most at home in scholarly surroundings.
This is aU we know about the Consul’s participation in the Venetian Efe of his day.
With the EngEsh his links were much stronger. We find him writing to Gori of his friend the ‘celeberrimo S.r Dottor Mead’,5 the most stimulating art collector of early eighteenth-century England and the great friend of Sir Isaac Newton, in whom Smith himself was closely interested.6 His official duties brought him into touch with many of the most important visitors to Venice, but besides these his house was always open to English connoisseurs or artists in the city whom he treated with great courtesy. At one time or another John Breval, Horace Walpole, Richard Wilson, Sir Joshua Reynolds, James Wyatt and Robert Adam were aU welcomed by him.’ But no one really liked him. Walpole characteristically jeered at him as ‘the Merchant of Venice’; Lady

[Page 302]
Mary Wortley Montagu found the self-congratulation with which he rendered her a service overwhelming; and James Adam burst out in a fit of rage: ‘As to Smith’s flummery ’tis all good for nothing with him—mere words, of course, that have no meaning except when he has some favour to ask.’1 Even across the centuries we sense something vaguely unattractive about the man—the obsequiousness of his dealings with the King; the cynicism of his first marriage to the rich but mad operatic singer
Katherine Tofts; his grotesque though pathetic pursuit of Giustiniana Wynne; and finally his second marriage, when aged 82, to the sister of John Murray, the Resident— the very job that he had wanted for himself.
Despite the unease that he inspired in his fellow-countrymen and despite the fact that he lived abroad virtually all his life, like so many Englishmen in a similar situation he insisted on retaining the atmosphere of his native land. When Mme du Boccage visited Venice in 1757 she noted that Smith’s palace was ‘entirely in the English taste; the very tables and locks of the gates are made after the manner of that country’.2
And yet this palace was by that time full to capacity with Italian paintings, not all of which would have suited the taste of an English gentleman at home. When he began collecting in the 1720s, Smith turned first to Sebastiano Ricci, at that time considered the finest painter in Venice. The veteran Lazzarini had virtually retired; his pupil
Tiepolo was still too young to be known outside a restricted circle. Yet Ricci, for all the esteem in which he was held, was employed far more outside Venice, principally by the court of Turin, than in the city itself, where his most important commissions were largely confined to the Church, and henceforward to Smith.
The pictures that Smith bought or commissioned from the artist were painted in his most scintillating manner, and many of them were freely adapted from Veronese.3
The most important were seven large pictures of themes from the New Testament which he hung together in a special room in his palace and which he had engraved and described in 1749, along with seven cartoons by the Bolognese Carlo Cignani, an artist enormously admired in early eighteenth-century Venice, which were hung in another room.4 These paintings from the New Testament may well be connected with a similar series that Ricci was engaged on for the court of Turin at much the same moment.6
In fact, apart from their sine quality all Smith’s Riccis are of a kind which suggests either that they were bought from the artist or his heirs after his death or that, if
In the Galleria di Minerva, VI, 1708, p. 83, an anonymous writer said of Cignani, ‘nessuno ha saputo fin’ora vendere in vita i suoi Quadri a si alto prezzo’.

[Page 303]
commissioned, Smith had as yet formed no distinctive taste of his own. The remaining thirteen religious and classical compositions are of subjects that were commonplace in the artistic repertory of the day, and the fact that Smith also owned a series of studies of heads copied from Veronese strongly suggests that he acquired a section of the artist’s studio en bloc—for such' a commission would be most unusual. And it is likely that he acquired the 211 miscellaneous drawings which date from various periods in Ricci’s Use in the same way.
Many of these pictures have landscape backgrounds by Sebastiano’s nephew, Marco, and he too was very fully represented in Smith’s collection. Once again it is not clear what proportion of the 42 paintings and nearly 150 drawings were directly commissioned by him, for the subjects offer no clue and one of the drawings is dated 1710, when it is most unlikely that the two men knew each other. Some of them were engraved by Antonio Maria Zanetti in a book which recorded a few of his own paintings by Marco Ricci and which he dedicated to Francesco Algarotti in 1743.1 The subjects include fantastic Roman ruins, genre scenes from country life and a number of landscapes (Plate 55b).
Among other artists whom Smith was especially patronising in the 1720s was
Rosalba Carriera. There are records that she knew him in 1721 and was working for him by 1723 so that she must have been among the very first painters he employed— indeed her name appears first on the list of his pictures which he drew up when he sold them to George III.2 Throughout 1725, 1726 and 1728 she was receiving payments from him, and we also know that Smith obtained commissions for her from other Englishmen.3 In the end his large collection of pastel portraits formed the best known group of her paintings in Venice: in particular it contained what was universally recognised to be her masterpiece, Winter, represented (in Smith’s words) by a ‘Beautiful Female covering herself with a Pelisse allowed to be the most excellent this Virtuosa ever painted.’4 Smith commissioned two versions of this, and after keeping the one he liked best for himself, he sent the other to a friend (or client).5 He obviously guarded it jealously, for writing to Rosalba from London in 1735, a Mr Robert Dingley asked for a picture ‘of a pretty young country girl... in the style of the Winter in Mr Smith’s collection.... There is no need to say anything to Mr Smith about this... . .’6
Such then are the outlines of Smith’s career as collector and patron until about 1730.
He was now aged 55, and living in the Palazzo Balbi near the Rialto where he had
Ashburn, 1781, Vol. IV: ‘Giacché Ella intende di voler finire anche l’altro Inverno, quando ciò si potesse terminare per Lunedi desiderei molto volentieri vederlo à confronto dell’altro per poter allora con più fondamento risolvere quali di Due inviare all’atnico.’ 6 Malamani, 1899, p. 134.

[Page 304]
settled on arrival; in 1731 he bought the country house at Mogliano near Treviso which he had leased four years earlier from the Procuratore di San Marco, Gerolamo
Canal.1 In these two properties he displayed his paintings and drawings by Sebastiano and Marco Ricci, Carlo Cignani and Rosalba Carriera and probably also Piazzetta with whom he was in touch during these years.2 It was already the most important collection of modern art to be found in Venice (and there was also a growing number of old masters), but reflected no particular originality of outlook. From now on, however, there seems to be a change in direction, and Smith began to accumulate a series of pictures which made his palace unique as an expression of individual taste. Essentially the shift reflected—consciously or not—one that was taking place at the same time in his native England: a move away from large-scale history pictures towards views and landscapes, though in his case not towards portraits. It is indeed remarkable that though he was anxious to have portraits of all the artists who worked for him, he never seems to have commissioned one of himself.
The new direction of his patronage was marked above all by his employment of
Canaletto: the relations between the two men were central in the careers of both.
Though there is no conclusive record of their having been in touch before 1729, it seems likely that Canaletto actually began working for Smith a year or two earlier, by which date he was already a well-known artist with a European clientèle. Thereafter
Smith directed his whole output almost entirely into English channels, and conspicuously into his own collection. The exact nature of their relations has been extensively and authoritatively discussed, but remains uncertain.3 There is, however, no doubt whatsoever that Smith’s control over the artist was such that from a very early period commissions for his works were very frequently, if not exclusively, made through him.4
This was not altogether an easy matter, for both artist and business man had notoriously mean characters: ‘nor is it the first time’, Smith wrote angrily after a brush in 1729,
‘[that] I have been glad to submitt to a painter’s impertinence to serve myself and friends’. He was, however, not the man to be put off by difficulties of this kind, and he retained his self-appointed role as the agent through whom Canalettos were purchased.
It is probably this that the Swedish visitor Count Tessin meant when he said in 1736 that for a term of four years Canaletto was engaged by Smith to work exclusively for him.6 Certainly besides the pictures that Smith obtained for others he was keeping a very large number for himself—far more than the fifty-three at present in the Royal
Collection7—so that, if we include in the phrase ‘work exclusively for him’ those

[Page 305]
pictures that Smith was commissioning for other customers, there is no reason to doubt the substantial truth of Tessin’s observation.
Smith’s first Canalettos were six views of S. Marco and its immediate surroundings, larger than anything he had painted until then, bold, free and almost impressionistic.1
They are among his finest works, and in many ways the antithesis of what was to be his characteristic style when later working for the Consul and other English patrons.
Already there is a change in the fourteen pictures which he painted for him between
1730 and 1735: the treatment is now less dramatic and much more sober. This change corresponds to the evident purpose of the series. With two large exceptions—depicting regattas—the group consists of twelve small views of Venice, chosen not because of the interest, importance or beauty of the objects to be represented, but purely so as to achieve a documentary record of the whole Grand Canal. Up and down, very systematically, the painter has worked his way through this great artery, leaving as fine and yet as unpretentious a memorial as any city has ever had. Such an attitude to art was quite new. Painters, even the most distinguished ones, had often been employed to record important scenes from contemporary Use for their patrons or merely buildings and landscapes which were particularly associated with them. Other artists had exploited the ‘picturesque’ elements of back streets and slum Use and ruins. Yet others had painted individual buildings of outstanding architectural interest. But these are all the very elements that are missing in this series. With his eye firmly on the Canal the artist here often records the palaces and churches in such steep perspective that we are not intended to admire them in themselves. There is something curiously prosaic and business-like in this approach of a painter who had until now shown himself so dramatic, indeed romantic. It is almost as if the patron were drawing up a prospectus, a sort of visual catalogue, of Canaletto’s abilities. Can this in fact have been the real motive for these pictures? There is some evidence for the theory. In 1735 Visentini’s engravings of the series were published, thus giving tourists an easy opportunity to get to know it.' A year later Tessin reports that Canaletto has been engaged to paint exclusively for Smith for four years. And, paradoxically enough, it seems that at this very time Canaletto had virtually ceased working for Smith.
There are no paintings by Canaletto in the Consul’s collection between the series engraved by Visentini and a number some ten years later. But it was at this very moment that Canaletto obtained some of his most important commissions from English visitors.
If the Visentini series was indeed intended as an advertisement—if the pictures were painted, in fact, with the engravings in mind—the scheme was remarkably successful.
For it was during the last half of the 1730s that Canaletto painted twenty views for the
Duke of Bedford, another series of twenty for Sir Robert Hervey, and seventeen for the
Earl of Carlisle. In all these groups the artist pays far more attention to the accurate delineation of specific buildings than he had done when working for Smith. And it is now that we first notice the mannerisms, the harshness, the signs of studio assistance—all

[Page 306]
the deterioration that was to become charactèristic of a painter ‘whom the English have spoilt’. -
It is impossible to tell exactly what Smith was doing during this period. No doubt he was buying old masters extensively. And he must also have been forming and adding to his great collection of drawings—in 1734 Sebastiano Ricci died and it was probably then that Smith acquired much of the contents of his studio. Many illustrated editions of books were pubhshed by Pasquali during these years, and Smith retained the original drawings most of which were by Visentini.1 ,
We know too that he was buying gems and cameos, and from the many letters that he wrote about these to the Florentine antiquary A. F. Gori in 1737 and 1738 we can derive our only explicit indication of his artistic tastes.2 He emerges as an enthusiastic and apparently discriminating collector. ‘It makes no difference to me,’ he writes,3
‘whether the stone be cut or the figures in relief or of what size they be, as long as the workmanship is excellent; and although I do like modern things when they are extremely beautiful, I must be understood always to give preference to the antique, without however blindly praising a bad piece just because it is antique. If I come across beautiful things, I am glad to pay what they are worth.’ Many people, including, naturally, the dealers of the time, went out of their way to praise Smith’s choice of stones,4 but not everyone would have acknowledged his claims of generosity or even taste. Girolamo
Zanetti later said that his brother Antonio Maria who copied Smith’s gems for publication had been extremely badly paid, and he commented scathingly on the quality and authenticity of many of the Consul’s ‘antiques’,5 despite the fact that Smith always showed himself careful to distinguish between ‘the good or, rather, excellent works of the sixteenth century when fine masters were alive’ and those produced in more recent years.
It was at about this time too that the connoisseur John Breval visited Smith’s collection and was shown a little statuette which represented ‘seemingly an Aesculapio1 Blunt and Croft-Murray, pp. 67 if.
B. VIII, 13, p. 170: ‘Vengo al Pasquali. La faccenda appartiene tutto al Console Brittanico Smith. Mio fratello dissegnò le gemme e i Cammei, e gli Vantaggiò di molto colla matite perchè gli originali non sono di quella perfezione, che si vorrebbe far vedere. Molti, se non ¡sbaglio, sono moderni . . .’ [in margin:
‘Fu assai male ricompensato.’]

[Page 307]
Priapus; with a Pudendum of monstrous proportion’ as well as some more conventional sculptures, the Cignani cartoons and various books and antiquities.1
Early in the ’forties he resumed the patronage of contemporary artists on a large scale, and also engaged in two interesting and important transactions. In 1741 he sold a number of paintings, which are now impossible to identify, to the Elector of Saxony2 and in the same year, or thereabouts, he bought a collection of Dutch and Flemish pictures from the widow of the artist Pellegrini.3 Indeed, it was almost certainly from her that he acquired at least one of his masterpieces of Dutch painting—Vermeer’s
Lady at the Virginals (now in Buckingham Palace). It has been claimed that theWermeer greatly influenced Canaletto’s development,4 but though the theory is a tempting one, it is difficult to substantiate. If this picture, which was then in no way singled out for special praise and, indeed, was attributed to the secondary painter Frans van Mieris, really came from Pellegrini’s widow, it arrived at a time when Canaletto’s style was already fully formed and his best days were nearly over. In any case the subtly modulated lighting and precision of the Dutch interior bears little relation to the huge views which
Canaletto was then painting. For it was now, soon after the outbreak of the war of the
Austrian succession in 1740, which so cut down the numbers of English tourists, that he once again began to work for his most persistent patron.
Canaletto’s return to Smith marked a very striking change both in his style and in his subject-matter. He entirely gave up the small-scale views of Venice, on which his international reputation was securely based, and turned instead to grandeur and fantasy and a vastly increased range of subjects. There was quite possibly a second visit to
Rome, perhaps with Smith, and this led to the painting of six views of ancient Roman monuments. These were the largest pictures that Canaletto ever painted for Smith, and if for no other reason they must have made a great impact among those in his collection. And their subjects made them unique in Venice. With their concentration on the grandest of antique monuments they were like some signal to show that Rome and Roman values were once more about to resume the leading role in Italian art. Yet this is still Rome as seen by the outsider, and consequently lacks that matter-of-fact element which was so characteristic of the Venetian views of his earlier years. Though the paint is now harsh, there is in these pictures something of a return to the dramatic vision of his very first pictures. It is significant that Smith should have wished for views of antiquity only and ignored the contemporary Rome of Pannini; yet it is hard to see these playing more than a symbolical role in the rise of the neo-classic.
This is worth stressing because the next few paintings commissioned from Canaletto so clearly were intended to portray the style of architecture that Smith particularly liked.
It was in 1744 that Canaletto painted the ‘13 Door Pieces ... [of] the principal Buildings

[Page 308]
of Palladio’.1 In fact, as Smith recognised in a note at the end of his catalogue, by no means all the pictures in the series do represent that architect’s works, but this first reference by him reveals clearly enough what was the aim of the group—to show the
‘most admired Buildings at Venice’. And the vast majority of these were by Palladian architects of the sixteenth century. Yet the series as a whole is not altogether consistent.
Alongside the bland, almost mathematically precise, views of the Rialto as planned by
Palladio or the Courtyard of the Carita are quite imaginary scenes such as the Horses of
St Mark’s detached from the church and placed on the piazza or a fantastic interpretation of the Scala dei Giganti. These are among the first ‘caprices’ in Canaletto’s’work and it is tempting to link them with the arrival in Venice in 1743 of Francesco Algarotti, who was later to show such enthusiasm for this type of picture and who was at this very time in touch with Smith. It is equally possible that Canaletto derived the idea from Pannini on his visit to Rome a year or two before, and it must certainly have been about now that he painted for Smith his two capricci with Roman ruins in ‘a bold frank manner’.2 Yet though such pictures are more readily associated with the fanciful Algarotti than the more phlegmatic temperament of Smith, it was to his English patron that
Canaletto dedicated in these very years by far his most poetic excursions into the field of the imaginary—the series of thirty-one etchings ‘altre prese da i Luoghi altre ideate’ (Plate 55a). These represent a side of Canaletto’s art which is totally absent in his paintings for the Consul, though it is occasionally hinted at in his drawings—an appreciation of distances, worn columns overhung with plants, the solitary black bird, arches, mountains. It is a deeply felt, informal, often poignant vision, in which—almost for the last time—Canaletto’s genius blazes at full power. Very soon afterwards he left for
England apparently on Smith’s recommendation and for nearly ten years there was little contact between the two men.
After Canaletto’s departure in 1746 Smith turned to two other artists to continue the series of overdoors illustrating Palladian architecture.3 Antonio Visentini had already been employed by him for more than fifteen years as an architect and book illustrator and Francesco Zuccarelli was an established landscape painter, who worked a great deal for Smith, though it is not clear whether his ‘6 Landscapes representing the story of Rebecca with Jacob and Esau’ and many other pictures had already been painted before 1746 or whether the commission of that year brought about the first contact between the two men. In any case Zuccarelli’s part in the enterprise was a minor one despite its greater artistic quality. It consisted of adding attractive decorative landscapes of the Venetian kind for which he was famous to the architectural views painted by
Visentini. The architecture was exclusively English and consisted of a series of country houses and surroundings which neither he nor his patron had ever seen. All were in the style which Lord Burlington and his followers had raised into a dogmatic canon of
1332, which is equivalent to 1753. Sir Anthony Blunt has solved the problem by suggesting that Canaletto accidentally added an extra x—see Exhibition of The King’s Pictures, 1946-7, No. 440.

[Page 309]
taste—the Palladian. Five of the eleven pictures portray works by Inigo Jones, two by
Lord Burlington, two by Colen Campbell, one by Roger Morris, and one—curiously enough—by Vanbrugh, though the example chosen shows him at his most Palladian.
In some cases separated buildings are combined, but none of these capricci includes the playful distortions of Canaletto’s Horses of St Mark’s and it is clear that the genre was not inherently sympathetic to Smith. The pictures were based primarily on engravings taken from Colen Campbell’s Vitruvius Britannicus, and as far as architectural details are concerned they are mostly of great, almost programmatic accuracy. The significance of the whole series is made absolutely clear by the portrait that Nogari was commissioned to paint for him of Inigo Jones, taken from ‘Vandyke, with the plan of the Banquetting
House in his hands’.1 Smith also brought out many editions of the works of Jones and
Palladio, and in 1767 he published one of the manuscripts in his collection by the seventeenth-century theorist TeoFilo Gallacini. The title was indicative: Trattato sopragli errori degli architetti, and within a very short time the book was brought up to date by
Antonio Visentini with a series of bitter attacks on the Baroque architects and their successors down to Piranesi. The effect was not missed by the Venetians who frequented
Smith’s palace, and later Andrea Memmo was to write that ‘a great number of books on architecture which I was able to see in his house, and the guidance of Signor Antonio
Visentini, made me pick out and prefer that style which is called pure and simple’.2
This devotion to the strict canons of neo-Palladianism in 1746 shows Smith conforming closely to the English taste at the very time when it was wearing somewhat thin in his own homeland. But it coincided with a move towards classicism that was felt in all branches of Venetian art during the ’forties and that Smith’s patronage during this decade did much to promote. Despite the commission of an important work from
Tiepolo, which came to nothing because it was expropriated by Algarotti for the court of Dresden,3 Smith tended to move away from history painting and fantasy and turn more than ever to landscapes and architectural paintings proclaiming the virtues of sobriety. This tendency continued in the’fifties—in the first year of that decade Visentini built a new classicising marble façade for his palace4—but by now his patronage of contemporary artists was greatly diminished. Zuccarelli went to England in 1752 and it may therefore have been at this period that Smith began employing Zais,5 whose landscapes he did not think worth including in the batch of pictures that he later sold to
George III. In the same year, however, he acquired some of his most magnificent drawings—including many by Castiglione and the Carracci—as well as some old master paintings from the heirs of Zaccaria Sagredo. He also bought some more pictures from Canaletto, among them a number of English views, on that artist’s return

[Page 310]
from London in 1755. These, together with the Riccis and Cignanis and most of his larger works, were hung in his palace; at his country house he kept the paintings by
Dutch and Flemish artists, a number of Zuccarellis and many of the old masters.1
By this time he was already nearly 80 and was making plans to dispose of his library and collections. In 1755 he published an inventory of his books, grandly but slightly absurdly called the Bibliotheca Smithiana, almost certainly designed as an elaborate sale catalogue, and a year later he began negotiations with the English royal family. These were interrupted almost at once by the outbreak of the Seven Years
War.2 '
Disappointment, old age and the disruption of trade deeply affected him, and he began to withdraw more and more from social Use. In 1756 he gave up his box in the theatre of S. Giovanni Crisostomo3 and four years later he resigned the consulship and wrote that he wished to return to England, ‘but first, having spent all my vacant time in amusements of admiring the sine arts and possessing considerable collections of tilings relating thereto . . .’ he proposed to visit the principal towns of Italy, as he knew only
Venice.4 At just this time James Adam met him and wrote5 that he was ‘devilish poor
& should he live a few years longer which he may do, he will die a Bankrupt... he has a fine collection which he ought to sell if vanity wou’d allow him, but he is literally eaten up with it’. However, in 1762, after difficult negotiations he at last managed to sell most of his best pictures, books, drawings and gems to King George III. Even so, enough remained to cover his walls. His vitality was impressive: he still actively engaged in business, including picture dealing, and in 1766 he again became Consul for a few months. But, apart from this, he seems to have lived a retired fife, attracting little attention from native Venetians or tourists. He finally died in 1770, two years after
Canaletto, with whom he will always be associated.

Franceschini painted for him a Venus and The Three Graces, and Dal Sole a St Teresa wounded by Christ and a Rape of the Sabines—Zanotti, I, pp. 228 and 306-7.

4 De La Fosse’s reported remark to Ricci, ‘Paint nothing but Paul Veroneses and no more Riccis’, quoted by Levey, 1959, p. 22, from Walpole’s Anecdotes must presumably have been made on this occasion. 5 Blunt and Croft-Murray, 1957, pp. 61-3.

4 McSwiny spelt his name in a great number of different ways at various stages in his career, for the broad outlines of which see Dictionary of National Biography. See also Whitley, I, pp. 9, ir, 24-6, and a number of librettos for operas adapted by him which are now in the British Museum.
6 Vertuc, III, p. 82.
6 There have been many articles about McSwiny’s commissions in recent years—see Voss, 1926, pp. 32-7; Arslan, 1932, pp. 128-40, and 1933, pp. 244-8; Zucchini, 1933, pp. 23-30; Borenius, 1936, pp. 245-6; Watson, 1953, pp. 362-5; Constable, 1954, p. 154!

2 Solimena was apparently considered for Sir Isaac Newton’s tomb as is shown in a letter from McSwiny to the Duke of Richmond dated 28 November 1727 kindly shown to me by Mr Francis Watson. Francesco Imperiali of Rome painted the monument to King George I, a version of which belongs to Lord Kemsley—English Taste in the Eighteenth Century, 1955-6, p. 54.

1 The Venetian artists concerned in the enterprise were: Canaletto Lord Somers (Birmingham) Cimaroli Piazzetta Marco Ricci Duke of Devonshire (Barber Institute) Sebastiano Ricci Domenico Valeriani William III (Duke of Kent) Giuseppe Valeriani Cimaroli Balestra Domenico Valeriani Isaac Newton (Fitzwilliam Museum) Giuseppe Valeriani Pittoni Canaletto Archbishop Tillotson (English private collection) Cimaroli Pittoni Paltronieri Lord Dorset (Rome, private collection) Cimaroli Pittoni Marco Ricci Sir Cloudesly Shovel (Washington) Sebastiano Ricci Canaletto? Lord Stanhope (Walter Chrysler collection) Cimaroli?
2 Constable, 1954, p. 154. In fact there is a great deal of confusion about which of these pictures were actually acquired by the Duke of Richmond. In 1741 McSwiny published nine of them in the Tombeaux des Princes and said that they all belonged to the Duke. These were those to William III, Tillotson, Malborough, Godolphin, Dorset, Cowper, Sir Cloudesly Shovel, Newton and Boyle/Locke/Sydenham.
1 Letter from John Conduitt to McSwiny of 4 June 1729 kept among the Conduitt papers in the Library of King’s College, Cambridge. I am most grateful to-Mr A. N. L. Munby for pointing out this correspondence to me—Haskell, 1967.
2 The Duke of Devonshire thus altered must be another version of the one which once belonged to the Duke of Richmond and is now in the Barber Institute. The one of Sir Cloudesly Shovel has not yet been traced, but this too must have been a second version of the one belonging to the Duke of Richmond.

1 The inscription plate to Sir Isaac Newton’s monument, which is very much more restrained than all the others, was designed by Joseph Perrot. Boucher, however, drew the medallion of Newton and the signs of the Zodiac above the extracts from Fontenelle’s Eloge which are published on a separate page.
2 Malamani, 1899, p. 142, publishes a letter of 1753 to Rosalba Garriera with a reference to McSwiny who had apparently not settled some account with her.

3 It is true that Amigoni was born in Naples, but he spent his working life in Venice when he was not abroad. Amigoni was followed to Madrid in 1753 by Corrado Giaquinto, whose influence on the young Goya was far greater than that of any other Italian painter.

2 We can get some impression of Smith’s business activities after about 1740 from the papers of his notaio,Lodovico Gabrieli, among which references to Smith are very frequent—see in Archivio di Stato, Sezione Notarile—Atti del Notaio Lodovico Gabrieli, Buste 7559-7570 (1740-70). Unfortunately I have not been able to trace who was his notaio before that date. Also in the Archivio di Stato, among the papers of the Avogaria di Comun—Civil 263/16—is an account of a dispute between Smith and the Arte de’ Salumieri.

1 See p. 299, note 4. Grosley, who was in Venice in 1758, writes—U, p. 99—‘LJImprimerie de JeanBaptiste Pasquali, l’une des meilleures et des plus occupées de Venise, roule, pour la plus grande partie, sur les fonds de M. Joseph Smith; riche Anglois qui a vielli dans le Consulat d’Angleterre à Venise.’ .  2 The case os Canaletto is discussed separately, but it seems likely that Smith had some similar arrangement with Visentini.
3 See Previtali.
4 There are two very friendly letters from Poleni to Smith, dated 9 and 17 April 1747, in the Biblioteca Marciana—MSS. Ital:Cl.X. Cod CCLXXXVIII—6580. In these Polòni asks Smith to obtain some drawings for him from Visentini. There is an answer to the first of these letters, dated 14 April 1747, in which Smith refers to ‘l’antica mia servitù et perpetua stima’.
6 See p. 299, note 4. The undated letter is on page 211.
6 Smith and Pasquali published many books referring to Newton. In a note on page 30 of his Tempio della Filosofia, 1757, the poet Arrighi-Landini tells how Smith supplied him with a copy of Pope’s famous epitaph.
