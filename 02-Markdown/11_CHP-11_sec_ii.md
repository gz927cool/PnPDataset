MARSHAL SCHULENBURG
Another foreigner was commissioning and collecting pictures in Venice at much the same time as Joseph Smith, and the contrasts in background and activities between
Marshal Schulenburg and the English Consul are reflected very closely in their aesthetic tastes. There is no record that they were on close terms, and although they often employed the same artists, their collections were very different.

[Page 1661]
Johann Matthias Schulenburg, who came from a Saxon family, was born in 1661.1
After studying in France and Germany, he served as a professional soldier in most of the great wars fought throughout Europe at the turn of the century. He fought for the
Hungarians and for the House of Savoy; he fought for the Saxons in a scries of engagements against Charles XII of Sweden about which he liked to talk in later life; and he fought in the wars of the Spanish Succession, serving under Prince Eugene at Malplaquet. It was this latter connection that brought about his association with Venice, for when in 1715 the Republic appealed to Eugene for help against the Turks he advised them to turn to Schulenburg. This advice was fully justified by the Marshal’s'brilliant defence of Corfù against Turkish onslaughts in 1715 and 1716. The campaign, which was commemorated by various works of art commissioned both by Schulenburg himself and by the State, earned him the enthusiasm of Europe and the particular gratitude of Venice, which erected a statue to him and awarded him a life pension of
5000 ducats a year.2 He continued to serve the Republic, though there was no further opportunity for actual fighting, and after travel all over Italy as well as to London,
Berlin, Dresden and Holland, he settled in Venetian territory. He divided the last years of his life between Venice and Verona, where he died and was given a splendid funeral in I747?
Schulenburg remained a grandiose figure in his retirement. He was closely related to the Hanoverian dynasty and was on friendly terms with half the crowned heads of
Europe, whose portraits—Bourbons and Hapsburgs, Farneses and Hohenzollerns— lined the walls of the Palazzo Loredan in which he lived. They would call on him during their visits to Venice and write to him for help and advice in problems of all kinds. Thus Crown Prince Frederick of Prussia (later the Great) applied to him for a young castrato of 14 or 15, but was disappointed that Schulenburg could only find ‘une fille âgée de près de trente ans’.4 The old Marshal himself would have seen the arrangement in a different light. He liked talking to his guests about women,5 and a young
English nobleman who fell ill during his tour of Italy was disconcerted to have his doctor sent for by Schulenburg ‘and strictly required ... to tell whether or not I had been claps. To these younger men Schulenburg with his lavish hospitality and stories of bygone wars was ‘un vieux bonhomme’ or ‘the oddest old fellow in the world’. But though amiable enough, he remained excessively proud and could be very rude. The will that he drew up in 1740 reveals a commanding spirit, keen to assert its authority over distant descendants—he had no children of his own—and determined to maintain

[Page 312]
in every way the noble status of his family.1 At one time or another nearly all the artists whom Schulenburg employed were commissioned to record his own dropsical features.
Piazzetta drew him several times (Plate 53a), he was painted by Bartolommeo Nazari,
Giuseppe Nogari, Giacomo Ceruti, Gian Antonio Guardi, Francesco Simonini and many others, sculpted by Corradini and Morlaiter, engraved by Pitteri. His principal battles were painted by Simonini, whom he apparently took on his campaigns with him, and in 1726 he employed Canaletto to paint a view (probably taken from a print) of Corfu, the scene of his greatest triumph.2 All these artists he treated with royal generosity.3
Schulenburg’s collecting began suddenly in 1724 with a large purchase of old master paintings and sculpture from a lawyer, Giovanni Battista Rota, who also acted as an art dealer.4 Most of these came from the gallery of the last Duke of Mantua,
Ferdinando Carlo Gonzaga, many of whose belongings turned up on the Venetian art market after his exile and death in Padua following the Austrian occupation of his state in 1706. The sculptures included a bas-relief by Puget of the Assumption of the Virgin which was highly valued, and among the pictures were many attributed to Raphael,
Correggio, Giorgione and particularly to Giulio Romano and Castiglione, both of whom had been much employed by the Gonzaga in happier days. Unlike Smith,
Schulenburg showed a notable interest in contemporary Venetian sculpture, and among the works he bought from other collectors and sometimes commissioned were a large group of bronzes by Bertos (including an equestrian portrait of himself) and marbles by
-Corradini (including a modello of the statue of himself which the Republic had commissioned for the island of Corfu). His taste in old master paintings, as far as can be seen from the list of his purchases, was conventional except for the very extraordinary inclusion of a picture claimed to be by Giotto.
His relations with contemporary artists are of much greater interest. The first with whom he came into touch seems to have been Gian Antonio Guardi who worked for him for some fifteen years from before 1730 until 1745. Guardi received a monthly salary from Schulenburg and was clearly looked upon by him not so much as an
Keysler, III, p. 296, writes of Schulenburg’s collection: ‘Some pieces by Castiglione deserve particular notice, together with the last siege and new fortifications of Corfu, which are not only represented in paintings but there is likewise a model of them cut in wood.’
Canaletto’s painting is described as follows in Schulenburg’s inventory—see p. 313, note 3: ‘Canalera
—I Tableau grand rep:te la Perspective de Corfu pend.t le Siege fait des Turcs dans l’Année 1716 avec la
Perspective de son Canal, une partie de l’Ile et de la Terre ferme Ottomane, outre les deux Armées
Navales, savoir la Vénitienne, et l’ottomane tirée en file.’ Many other models and pictures of Corfu are recorded in the inventory.
For some of Schulenburg’s portraits see Morassi, 1952, pp. 85-91.

original painter in his own right as a useful copyistand hack. During the whole period ofhis employment only once—in 1737—was he commissioned to paint history pictures of his own; and the miserable sum he was then paid (about ten zecchini for the lot) shows that they must have been small and of little consequence. In general, he was required to copy masterpieces of the Venetian Cinquecento—Veronese’s Marriage at
Cana in S. Giorgio Maggiore and Madonna and Child with Saints in S. Zaccaria, Tintoretto’s Temperance and Fortitude in the Madonna dell’Orto, Bassano’s Nativity in S.
Giorgio Maggiore—and even pictures by his own contemporaries, Sebastiano Ricci,
Piazzetta and Rosalba Camera. His remaining time was spent on churning out an endless succession of portraits, sometimes as many as six a year, of Schulenburg himself to be given to his friends and royal admirers, or of those grand connections to be hung on his own walls. It is not surprising that the quality of those that have survived is generally low1; only.rarely does the Guardi magic transform an obviously pedestrian original into a work of authentic beauty, most conspicuously in the little Turkish scenes copied in 1742 and 1743 from engravings taken from Van Mour—here at last the artist was given the opportunity to display his talent for delicate and sparkling fantasy.2 There is a strange irony in the situation. Schulenburg, who was Guardi’s most persistent patron, wholly failed to appreciate the true nature ofhis gifts except on the one occasion when he ordered him to paint these idyllic versions of the customs of his most ferocious enemies.
In fact, the Marshal’s tastes veered in a very different direction. The nucleus ofhis collection was made up oshistory and genre paintings by Pittoni and Piazzetta.3 During the ’thirties, when Schulenburg was commissioning pictures from him, Pittoni was considered to be one of the leading history painters in Venice. Almost alone among his fellow-citizens he would be asked to contribute a canvas when large-scale international commissions were being planned for some royal court, and he was already much in favour with German patrons.4 For Pittoni turned the main episodes of Greek, Roman and Biblical history into melodramas which represented for his contemporaries the most acceptable and up-to-date versions of the old Baroque themes. Unlike Tiepolo who largely confined himself to frescoes, Pittoni rarely painted other than easel pictures and he was therefore much in demand among collectors. For Schulenburg he produced a series of pictures illustrating scenes of high Greek and Roman valour and sacrifice—
Scipio and Alexander the Great, Polyxena and Iphigenia.
Piazzetta enjoyed a closer relationship with Schulenburg than any other artist except
Gian Antonio Guardi, and in his case the results of this patronage were wholly beneficial.
For the Marshal must have seen that Piazzetta’s gifts did notdie in scenes of dramatic

[Page 314]
action of the kind painted by Pittoni, and he therefore employed him on a totally different type of picture which brought out the very best of this painter’s talents. It was
Piazzetta also who acted as Schulenburg’s chief agent in the purchase of interesting pictures on the market—usually Flemish.1 For the old Marshal was particularly fond of
Dutch and Flemish painting—a taste that was reflected in the type of patronage he afforded to Certain Venetian artists. He owned a drawing by Piazzetta of ‘des animaux et figures à la flamande’ and some twenty heads of men and women by Bartolommeo
Nazari and Giuseppe Nogari in a genre that ultimately looked back to Rembrandt. It was this taste for Flemish art that encouraged the Marshal to commission naturalistic painting. Thus Piazzetta painted for him subjects such as a Beggar holding a Rosary, a
Girl with a Basket of Chickens and, above all, the great pastorals or idylls, now in Cologne and Chicago. The significance of these pictures is not clear. Piazzetta himself who drew up the inventory of Schulenburg’s collection naturally valued them very highly, but described them merely as ‘représentant une femme assise au naturel, avec un garçon entre les Jambes, un panier de raisins en main, des chiens, qui aperçoivent un canard dans l’eau et deux hommes en distance’ and ‘Une femme avec un parasol, une servante, un paysans, un garçon qui dort, et la tête d’un bœuf’ (Plate 54). It has been suggested that the former picture contains a hint of social satire.2 While this is almost certainly wrong, it does at least make the point that the pictures were probably taken to be far more ‘realistic’ than our present appreciation of their poetic qualities allows. No pictures of comparable size showing ordinary people were painted during the eighteenth century in Venice except on occasion by Piazzetta himself. But perhaps the best reason for believing that they appealed to a taste for naturalism in the Marshal is that his gallery contained so many other genre pictures. In particular he owned seven by the provincial realist Giacomo Ceruti, some of which portrayed beggars and others animals.3 These pictures alone would suffice to make Schulenburg’s collection unique in Venice; and if we imagine them hanging in his palace along with his Piazzettas and his various Dutch and Flemish masters, we can see that the effect must have been strange enough to his visitors brought up so largely on histories and mythologies.
Like Smith, Schulenburg patronised the vedutisti and landscape painters, but with one or two important exceptions he owned nothing by Canaletto whose close relations with the English made it difficult for other residents in Venice to acquire his work.
Instead he owned a view and a number of landscapes by Marieschi, and others by
Carlevarijs, Cimaroli, Joli and especially Marco Ricci and Zuccarelli.4
Schulenburg’s collection of pictures attracted less attention from travellers than did
Smith’s largely because he was constantly sendingcrates of them back to his estates in

[Page 315]
Germany. He began doing this in 1735, and thereafter he sent dozens of pictures on two or three occasions every year. If we try and reconstruct the collections of the two men and compare them, we notice several differences. Smith’s was based largely on
Sebastiano Ricci, Rosalba Carriera and Canaletto—all painters who were represented---- rather weakly in Schulenburg’s, though he owned a portrait and some paintings of Ricci and was on good terms with Rosalba.1 Schulenburg’s collection was rich in works by
Piazzetta, Pittoni and Gian Antonio Guardi, none of whom -was particularly favoured by Smith. Both men owned works by Marco Ricci and Zuccarelli, though Smith had a far greater number. Neither had any painting by the finest artist of the age,-Tiepolo.
Smith showed a characteristically English penchant for landscape and views, Schulenburg for history, portrait and genre.

SIGISMUND STREIT
Curiously enough a third foreign collector long resident in Venice seems to hold a position midway between those of the two great patrons who have just been discussed.
A businessman like Smith, a German like Schulenburg and, like him, in close touch with Frederick the Great, Sigismund Streit owned far fewer pictures than cither—only forty-eight in all—and made little impact on Venetian society. But some were of good quality and they seem to reflect so sensitively their owner’s similarities and discrepancies with Smith and Schulenburg that they are worth discussing here.2
Sigismund Streit was born in Berlin in 1687, the son of a blacksmith, and he came to Venice in 1709. He soon began to engage in commercial activities which won him a fortune. He retired in 1750 and four years later he settled in Padua, moving to Venice only during the winters. He seems to have begun collecting pictures only about ten years earlier when he was already well past middle age and in 1758 and again in 1763 he bequeathed those he had acquired to various institutions, especially the Gymnasium zum Grauen Kloster in Berlin where he had been educated. He died, a bachelor, in 1775 and was buried in the Protestant cemetery of S. Cristoforo.
One of the strongest emotions in Streit’s life was his admiration for Venice, the city that had transformed his situation and turned him into the rich and complacent figure who gazes at us from Amigoni’s portrait. He arranged for a yearly speech to be made in
Berlin, in honour of his adopted city, and of the pictures he owned a strikingly high proportion were painted to celebrate its beauties and traditions. Works of art held a far more specific and also a far more personal meaning for Streit than they did for more sophisticated collectors. Of his four Canalettos, two showed scenes which were directly concerned with his own life, as he pointed out in the long notes which he made about

[Page 316]
his pictures,1 One portrayed a sweep of the Grand Canal looking south-east from the
Campo S. Sofia to the Rialto. Well in the foreground is a gondola in which stands Streit himself, while behind can be seen the Palazzo Foscari in which he lived. The other view was of the Campo di Rialto in which his business activities were carried out.
He was equally keen to have pictures of the ceremonies and festivals of the Republic. Two more Canalettos, among his very rare night scenes, show the Vigilie di S. Pietro and di S. Marta, the latter the most popular of all such occasions, and several other paintings by Canaletto’s followers recorded the Doge taking part in official processions.2
This section of Streit’s collection culminated in an allegorical ‘Glory of Venice’ which has unfortunately been destroyed...
Streit shared Schulenburg’s taste for portraits of royalty, and he commissioned his friend Antoine Pesne to paint Frederick the Great and the Queen.of Prussia. But, above all, he liked to see representations of himself-and his family. Portraits of his father, his mother and his sister hung from his walls as well as four of himself (Plate 53b)—not one of which wholly satisfied him.
Schulenburg was an enthusiastic collector of Pittoni and Piazzetta, Smith of
Sebastiano Ricci—it seems almost inevitable that Streit should have turned to Amigoni, who painted his portrait and ten other pictures for him between 1739 and 1746.3 Their subjects were among the most popular of the Old Testament and mythological repertoire, but they had none of the glitter or heroic melodrama of Ricci or Pittoni. In them everything tends to the pastoral or the mildly erotic. Suave and delicate, with no emotional change of key between Lot and his Daughters and Solomon adoring the Idols or between Bathsheba and the Sacrifice of Isaac, they were doubtless intended to be soothing to the eye of the tired businessman. This class of patron has since become much more familiar; in the early eighteenth century he was still rare.
Streit naturally owned a couple of Zuccarelli landscapes and the odd Dutch picture, but the only other artist well represented in his collection was Giuseppe Nogari. This painter was famous above all for his ‘teste di fantasia’—imaginary half-length portraits, strongly influenced by Northern artists especially Rembrandt, usually of old men and women. Streit had two of these—an Old man with a Pipe and Tobacco Pouch and an Old
Woman with Glasses, but he also employed Nogari to paint four allegories of Education and other elevating subjects which were characteristically turned by the artist into pretexts for rather mawkish genre—a branch of the art which he clearly found more congenial4 and which, as will be seen in the following chapter, was winning much support at the time in some of the more ‘progressive’ circles in Venetian society.
